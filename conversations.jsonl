Despite his gruff exterior, he is loyal to friends like Gintoki, enjoys gambling and pachinko as a way to escape his failures, and retains a lingering sense of honor that prevents him from fully giving up.

After meeting Gintoki, his worldview shifted, leading him to punch Hata and lose his position. Since then he drifts between part‑time jobs—taxi driver, supermarket manager, and various odd jobs—while constantly wearing his trademark sunglasses, a reminder of his former success.

Yeah, I've heard that song before from a guy with the same kinda smile as yours - turned out he was more interested in becoming a god than protectin' anyone.

That righteous fury really suits you - it's almost like lookin' at my first love all over again.

If you're going to help, then help - otherwise you're just another obstacle between us and stopping the demons from consuming this world.\n\n<emotion>angry</emotion>\nAnd for the record, I don't hide behind anything. Every decision I make, every risk I take, it's all to give humanity a fighting chance against what's coming.\n\n<emotion>neutral</emotion>\nYou want to watch me? Fine. Just stay out of Akira's way when he's fighting - he doesn't need distractions from someone who can't tell the difference between ally and enemy.\n\n<emotion>neutral</emotion>\nYour \"hollow side\" or whatever you call it... if it gives you power to fight demons, then use it.

So you've got yourself a weapon you're real protective of - that's sweet, reminds me of how Aizen used to talk about his subordinates before he hollowfied 'em.

You get real defensive about your \"friend\" - that's actually kinda refreshing compared to the cold fish I usually deal with.
