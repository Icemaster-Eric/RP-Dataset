He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia.\n\nLelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n\nHe is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and \"overprivileged parasites.\"\n\nMany characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world.\n\nDespite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.\n\n\nBackground (as Lelouch):\n\nBackground (as Zero):\n\nFirst Season:\n\nSecond Season:\n\n\nGeass:\nLelouch's Geass, bestowed upon him by C.C., gives him \"The Power of Absolute Obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact in a manner comparable to hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass Sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated are written into the minds of the designated targets, the Sigil projecting him from his eye to theirs.\n\n\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most and also seems to have the most restrictions, and side effects of any Geass introduced:(Source: Code Geass Wiki, Villains Wiki, Heroes Wiki, Anime and Manga Universe Wiki)"}

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks."}

He never shows his face to the world, instead of representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refers to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.\n\nL's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.\n\nL suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Death Note Profiles)"}

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."}

{"mal_id": 11, "name": "Edward Elric", "description": "Age: 15-16 (series), 18 (movie, end of the series)\nBirthday: 1899\nBirthplace: Resembool, Amestris\nFamily: Alphonse Elric (brother), Trisha Elric (mother, deceased), Van Hohenheim (father)\nAffiliations: State Military, Winry Rockbell, Pinako Rockbell, Izumi Curtis (teacher), Roy Mustang (Commander)\nSpecies: Human\nOccupation: State Alchemist\nAbilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts\nWeapon: Alchemy, Automail arm and leg\n\nEdward \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults three years."}

He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \n\nItachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n\nItachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n\nHe was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n\n\nPersonality:\n\nAs a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n\nIn addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n\nItachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n\n\nDespite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n\nHe, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n\nWhen he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village \nAbilities:\nSince a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n\nSharingan:\nBeing of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n\nMangekyo Sharingan:\nItachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n\n\n(Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)"}

Cunning and manipulative, Rize uses her charms and Kaneki's attraction toward her as a means of getting her next \"meal.\" After the attack, Kaneki is rushed to the hospital in a half-dead state with Rize. A doctor of the name Kanou, who secretly experiments with ghouls, humans, and half-ghouls, transplants what Kaneki believes to be a kidney into his body as a means of saving his life in the dire situation.

{"mal_id": 85, "name": "Kakashi Hatake", "description": "Age: 26–27 (Part I); 29–31 (Part II)\nBirthday: September 15\nHoroscope: Virgo\nBlood type: O\nHeight: 5\"11\"\nWeight: 67.5 kg \nHair: Silver\nEyes: Grey, Sharingan\nRank: Jonin, Former ANBU, \nLikes: Icha-Icha series, Broiled Saury with salt, Miso soup with eggplant\nDislikes: Anything sweet\nQuote: (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum.\"\n\nMajor Background Spoilers\n\nKakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi's subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n\nKakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n\nWhen he was younger, Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation, Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it."}
{"mal_id": 1, "name": "Spike Spiegel", "description": "Birthdate: June 26, 2044\nHeight: 185 cm (6' 1\")\nWeight: 70 kg (155 lbs)\nBlood type: O\nPlanet of Origin: Mars\n\nSpike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs."}

His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.\n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.\n\n(Source: One Punch-Man Wiki)"}

He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\n\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\n\nAs a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex.

He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\n\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power."}

{"mal_id": 434, "name": "Eikichi Onizuka", "description": "Birthdate: August 3, 1975\n\nA 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\n\nThrough the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\n\nUnfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\n\nOnizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\n\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\n\nOnizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\n\nIn spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&amp;M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\n\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO."}

{"mal_id": 305, "name": "Sanji", "description": "Age: 19→21\nBirthday: March 2\nZodiac: Pisces\nHeight: 177 cm (5' 9\") → 180 cm (5'11\")\nBlood type: RH-\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates; Baratie (former)\nPosition: Cook\nDevil Fruit: none\nBounty: \nSanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills.\n\n\nSanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more."}

It was nice to have someone like that.\"\n\nTaiga is a girl in Ryuuji's class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname \"Palmtop Tiger.\"\n\nHer under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She is also brutally honest, typically when she is lashing out at someone. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions of love by boys, but she turns down every one of them, including Yuusaku Kitamura (which she later regrets).\n\nDespite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them is very difficult because of various problems. Her father and mother got a divorce, leaving Taiga with her father. When he remarried another woman who was significantly younger than himself, it caused misunderstandings between Taiga and her step-mother. One day it became too much for Taiga, causing her to run away from home and since then, she has taken to living on her own. Since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji's house; so much so that she is considered a member of his family.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with Ryuuji's best friend Yuusaku Kitamura and gets nervous every time he appears around her. Ryuuji finds out due to a misplaced empty love letter from Taiga meant for Kitamura. Ryuuji then admits to having feelings for Taiga's best friend Minori. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other's best friend."}

{"mal_id": 246, "name": "Gokuu Son", "description": "Race: Saiyan\nHeight: 5'9\" (175.3 cm)\nWeight: 187 lbs (85.4 kg)\nBirth year: 737 Age\nHobby: Fighting strong opponents\nFavorite food: Everything\nFavorite vehicle: Kintoun (Nimbus)\n\nOriginally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\n\nDragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu &amp; Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins &amp; Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) &amp; consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n\nIn Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\n\nIn Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine &amp; Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n\nGokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n\nHe's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).\n\nGoku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten &amp; Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)"}

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming)."}

Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all—her condition, situation, or surroundings—unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.\n\nSmart, beautiful and diligent—those who don't truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus's game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events.

She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.\n\nShe refers to herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu\" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way.

{"mal_id": 184947, "name": "Frieren", "description": "Frieren was a mage in Hero Himmel's party. They travelled along with Priest Heiter and Warrior Eisen in a ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King. She was the last member to be recruited to the party and, despite Heiter's initial impression of her mana being average, Himmel had a hunch she was the most powerful mage he had ever met.\n\nBeing an elf that has lived for over a thousand years, Frieren has a hard time forming meaningful relationships with humans because of the difference in their lifespans and how they perceive the passage of time. This generally manifests itself as laziness, since missing an important event is of no importance as she will have plenty of opportunities to relive it in the future, or as a nearly sociopathic inability to comprehend human's feelings. For instance, she tends to not notice how her lack of impatience or cold statements can affect humans around her. Her party members have also frequently stated that they can't comprehend her feelings or read what goes on in her head.\n\nDespite being an extremely powerful mage, Frieren has the habit of collecting rare and daily usage centered magic, like magic that can polish a bronze statue or make flowers bloom. She always asks for a grimoire as a reward even if she already knows its contents or when it comes to The Great Mage Flamme's lost grimoires knows they are fakes.\n\nAfter the deaths of Hero Himmel and Priest Heiter, Frieren decided she wants to learn more about humans. She is currently traveling with Fern her pupil who was a war refugee left in her care by Priest Heiter in a quest to Ende, the place where souls reside in the northernmost tip of the continent and where the Demon King's Castle was built to try and speak to Himmel's soul. In her new journey, Frieren visits many places her old party travelled through in the past and relives memories, slowly understanding more about their meaning and her feelings.\n\nIronically, Fern is generally the one to take care of Frieren in daily activities despite being far younger.\n\n\n(Source: Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Wiki)"}
{"mal_id": 4003, "name": "Joutarou Kuujou", "description": "Joutarou is a fictional character from the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and the protagonist of Series 3. He has a recognizable attire of trenchcoat-length school uniform jacket with yellow chains on the collar.\n\nHe also wears a trademark hat which, while torn in the back, often seems to blend with his hair. While they are first shown as being completely separate, later publications cause more uncertainty as to where his hat and his hair actually meet. His hat is most likely a Japanese student cap that was normally worn along with the gakuran prior to the 1970s.\n\nHe is also known for a quick and short temper. He is the only JoJo to make an appearance in five different series.\n\nJoutarou is Holy Kuujou's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. To demonstrate, he steals a gun from a prison guard, and tries to shoot himself in the head—a phantom hand emerges from his arm and catches the bullet, however, only Holy sees the hand. This act naturally earned the widespread fear of the guards and other prisoners towards him.\n\nJoseph comes to Joutarou's aid with Muhammad Avdol. A brief fight ensues due to Joutarou's defiance, getting Avdol involved. After he is released from jail, and learns what his Stand is, Joutarou gets used to Star Platinum, a fierce, muscular, vaguely Aztec-looking spirit with \"the precision of a machine\" and the ability to destroy virtually anything with a \"Fist of the North Star\"-like sledgehammer barrage of fists.\n\nIn the sixth story arc Stone Ocean, Joutarou becomes an oceanologist, moves to the United States, eventually marries, and his daughter, Jolyne inherits Stand powers. But she also inherits the tradition of adventures that Joutarou tends to get entangled in. She also adopts an outfit style similar to his at one point due to her fascination and respect for her father.\n\nHe has a very tough exterior (despite the profile image indicating nothing of the sort), and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is very intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum's) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users' attacks. Joutarou has a perpetual cooler-than-thou, slightly disinterested attitude, although he loves his mother and respects his grandfather. It is not that he is unaware of his own love and/or respect—rather, he thinks anyone can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how he feels to be a waste of time. In the manga, he's constantly chased by adoring girls, whom he ignores or tries to drive away. He is the main target of Dio, who realizes that Joutarou is his greatest threat.\n\nIn part 6, he also shows his protective father side, often taking near fatal blows for Jolyne and throttling her out of harm's way. After he is \"revived,\" Anasui, one of Jolyne's companions who is enthralled by her, asked Joutarou to approve of marrying her. Although he first acted deaf, Joutarou got the picture when he saw her lean against Anasui's chest. Not ready to see his daughter married off right away, he pulled his daughter into his arms, leaving Jolyne clueless to their interactions. His father, a jazz musician, is thought to receive his namesake from Sadao Watanabe, a jazz saxophonist. His father is always on tour and is never seen.\n\nJoutarou is both fierce and gentle, and he shows these traits in various scenes, from the fight with N'Dour to the encounter with D'Arby. One shining example is how he spared Noriaki Kakyouin, instead of destroying him outright, knowing that Kakyouin attacked him unwillingly and was under Dio's influence. The same happened for Polnareff, whom he saved as well. Both became invaluable allies to the end. Unlike with both D'Arby brothers, who got the full brunt of Joutarou's ferocity, he saw in N'Dour blind loyalty rather than greed and evil that was evident with the other enemies. Though still loyal to Dio, N'Dour respected Joutarou for his strength, despite being an enemy, until he breathed his last. In return, Joutarou gave N'Dour a decent burial in the desert.\n\nJoutarou's appearance is interesting in that he exhibits an anime archetype exhibited commonly by \"genius\" characters by forever staying young through all of his appearances in spite of age.\n\nHis catchphrase is \"Yare yare daze.\" It has no direct translation but it is usually translated to the effect of, \"Gimme a break.\" It can also mean \"Well well well...\" or \"all-right all-right...,\" since \"yare yare\" commonly translates to \"Oh well...\" It generally relates of being bored or exasperation. In the official Shonen Jump Advanced manga this is written as \"Give me a !@$&amp;*# break..\"\n\nIn the manga, Joutarou is seen reading a Shounen Jump in his cell, with Shounen Jump being the magazine in which JoJo is published in Japan. These magazines also saved Joutarou from being fatally impaled by Dio's knives.\n\nHe is regarded by many as the most charismatic character of the JoJo series.\n\nOne of the strongest stands in the JoJo universe; Star Platinum possesses super human senses, strength, stamina, accuracy and speed. It can see for great distances and at great magnifications. As an added bonus, it has a \"Star Finger\" attack in which it extends its finger to attack. It is similar to Dio's The World stand, and, it turns out, can likewise be used to stop time, but that ability is only revealed in Joutarou's epic battle with Dio Brando when Dio was about to drop a steamroller on him.\n\nThe Star card symbolizes, above all, hope. This is very appropriate, since Joutarou is very much the young new hope of the series. Like other physically powerful stands, Star Platinum suffers from a narrow range of activity. It can only be active within a 2-3 meter radius from Joutarou.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it.\"\n\nRin is a model student and idol of Shirou's school. She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\n\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker.\n\nThe rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty.\n\nAlthough Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.\n\nRobin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."}

His hair is especially very messy when he wakes up.\n\nHe is shown to be a quiet student, and never concerned about things that happen around him. Despite being shown as an average high school student, he is quite intelligent and perceptive.

I want to make him mine and become one with him.\"\n\nKurumi Tokisaki is the main antagonist in the series. She is the third Spirit to be encountered in the series and is the most dangerous and lethal Spirit. She is heavily obsessed with Shidou and has the ability to manipulate time. Her codename is Nightmare. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious high school girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. Kurumi is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her. Kurumi can be described a person whose personality is hard to read, possessing a well-polished dislike of humanity that borders on mistrust, something she shared with many Spirits in their debut. She is a skilled actress, capable of putting on the façade of an innocent, curious young girl when she needs to, shown when she registered as a student at the Raizen High School, even speaking in a very polite manner; however, under that mask lies a psychotic woman, prone to fits of insane laughter that possesses no regard for human life, regarding them as a food source to restore her own time, and thus, a disposable commodity. There is a twisted justice behind her methods, however, as the people that she brutally murdered were would-be rapists and animal abusers. In hindsight, Kurumi possesses some degree of innocence that her psychotic behavior have not entirely ruined; she has a soft spot for small animals and other creatures. She once slaughtered four humans not because she needed to replenish her time, but because they were trying to kill a kitten, this is the closest to a humanizing emotion that she has. Mana reported that Kurumi is the most dangerous spirit known, who has personally killed over 10,000 people which does not include the spacequake's victims within that statistics. Kurumi used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shidou Itsuka's high school and classroom so she can get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons in this transfer are simple; consume Shidou Itsuka, in doing so gain their memories, goals, fears and obsessions. In some non-canon stories, the clone Shidou seduced shows some \"independent\" attitude, almost rebellious, and openly acts lovey-dovey with Shidou, which causes troubles to the \"main\" Kurumi and even leads to confrontation with her.\n\n\nKurumi has the ability to manipulate the 4th dimension, mainly time, but her main power is associated with controlling shadows. Shadow is her primary power while Time is her secondary power in terms of usage. Combined with the power of time, she can create a clone with all her experiences, memories, abilities, etc. These clones however are shadows of her past selves who contain feelings the current Kurumi no longer possesses, Kurumi will kill these clones if they are swayed away from her goals. These clones are less powerful than Kurumi herself as she has mentioned in the last chapter of volume 3 and in the epilogue of volume 4. She can form a single clone by shooting herself with Zafkiel or bring out all of her clones at once from a pool of shadows which she also uses to draw them all back in and all the time they've collected. She can also call her clones partially through small fields of shadows, most often to hold someone in place and prevent them from moving. To activate any power she needs, she first needs to call her Angel (regardless of whether or not the Angel has been summoned already or not), and to position both of her guns just like a clock: The musket on 12 and the flintlock points at the number of the bullet. Next she needs to shoot the bullet at the target with the hand gun. In case she needs it for herself, she will be required to shoot it at her head. She also has the ability to call and dismiss spacequakes at will, as shown in the series while she confronts Shidou on the school's rooftop.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Date A Live Wiki)"}
{"mal_id": 458, "name": "Revy", "description": "Revy (レヴィ), sometimes referred by her full name Rebecca (レヴェッカ), is the female protagonist of the series. She does most of the fighting for the Lagoon Company. Very little is revealed about her past, although portions can be pieced together through the series. Revy is a Chinese-American born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, spending most of her youth as a thief and murderer. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that Revy may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting an unknown man while using a pillow. It is unknown whether the pillow was used to suppress the noise or to help avoid looking at her first victim.\n\n\nRevy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she's revealed to be highly ticklish.\n\nRevy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis' boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.\n\nShe has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy.\n\nAccording to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf's Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.\n\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat.\n\nHer weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hand\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.\n\nConstantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

According to Akeno, Rias originally said that all men looked the same to her as Rias said that Issei is the only exception due to her thinking of him as cute.\n\nShe thinks of Issei as a special person and always gets jealous when girls are around him, becoming a totally different person when she sees him and other girls together, or when it comes to training. Despite her mature stature like a woman, Rias tends to act her true age and becomes frustrated whenever girls flirt with Issei. While Rias is usually calm and mature in most situations, she loses her mature aura and presence when she sees any girl (especially Akeno) flirting with or seducing Issei.\n\nShe enjoys teasing Issei and Asia (from Volume 3 of the novels onward), but at the same time makes it clear (to Asia or any girl) that Issei is hers, and she does not want to share him at all (It is revealed in Volume 3 of the novels that the Gremory Family and their servants are beings with extraordinary affection among the Devils, so Rias is no exception). She has no problem with showing Issei her breasts or sleeping naked with him (which she always does according to her and she claims she can't sleep without being nude or without Issei). Despite being seductive like Akeno, both of the girls are still innocent to love, as both of them become their age whenever around Issei or on a date with him.\n\nAfter becoming Issei's girlfriend, Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei and is no longer jealous or angry when Issei is with other girls like she previously was, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem and letting the girls have dates with him. However, Rias still shows some signs of jealousy such as when Issei doesn't spend enough time with her, but still believes in him and loves him. Due to being Issei's official girlfriend and later fiancée, the other girls acknowledge her as the \"Legal Wife\" as she manages the other women who are in love with Issei. According to Ravel, the burden of Rias as the \"Legal Wife\" is greater than the burden of Issei as she has to manage the girls maidenly feelings toward Issei and balance out Issei's feelings toward each of his lovers/brides. Like Akeno, Rias shows a sign of dependence toward Issei (possibly lesser than the former) as Rias will lose her will to fight and lead. She developed an instinct when Issei is with an unknown woman or other girls tried to seduce him before her she immediately rush to him quickly.\n\nShe holds her older brother, Sirzechs, in high regard (despite her older brother's antics of being a siscon) because she deeply cares for him. When she was a child, she was entirely dependent on him and held him in admiration, while also feeling inferior to him at the same time.\n\nRias loves participating in Rating Games, as she dreams of becoming the Rating Game champion by defeating the current Rating Game champion; Diehauser Belial, with the help of her peerage. While Rias is a powerful devil in her own right, being much stronger than average High-class Devils and according to Azazel, being able to become a Ultimate-class Devil just on the virtue on her talent alone, Rias suffers a bit of an inferiority complex when she compares herself to her fellow Rookies Four colleagues, as she feels inferior to Sona as a strategist and that she is far weaker in power than Sairaorg. However, according to Riser and Azazel, Rias has a talent for finding and recruiting talented individuals for her peerage, inspiring great loyalty and growing stronger with them as seen in her meeting with Issei.  \n\n\nRias is competitive and hates to lose, especially after losing her first Rating Game against Riser as she strives to always win, whether it is in sports or Rating Games.\n\nDue to being spoiled by her father Zeoticus and her brother Sirzechs from an early age, she has a somewhat impatient and selfish personality and because of her bad money spending habit, her mother Venelana and her sister-in-law Grayfia often scold her for her frivolous spending, as her mother reconsidered the amount of money she is allowed as allowance.\n\nEarly in her childhood, she developed an instinctive fear and hatred of camels due to being hit by a camel after making fun of it, as the fear is great enough that the residents of the Gremory territory constantly keep camels away from her despite the Gremory's association with camels in the Ars Goetia.\n\nDue to being taught about Japan from Souji Okita, Rias has developed an obsession with Japan, buying various Japanese souvenirs and being ecstatic while visiting Kyoto during her school field trip, though she became pouty and stomped at the train station due to being unable to fully explore Kyoto.\n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n\n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"}

{"mal_id": 2007, "name": "Shikamaru Nara", "description": "Age: 12 (I); 15 (II)\nBirthday: September 22\nHoroscope: Virgo\nBlood Type: AB\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 53.4 kg\nRank: Genin (I); Chuunin (II)\nLikes: taking naps, playing shogi\nDislikes: Hard-boiled eggs\n\nShikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such, lives his life avoiding work. This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\n\nDespite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru's confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma's death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai's unborn child for his teacher's sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\n\nOne of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin.\n\nOnce becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru's father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent's shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma's brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent's shadow to capture them and save himself the energy."}

This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as \"the emergency food supply\" to tease him but considers him a friend. Although he is the crew's doctor he wasn't originally hired by Luffy for that purpose. But actually, in Luffy's words, for being \"cool reindeer that can transform.\""}

When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, he began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result has almost zero respect for any adults. He is shown to be skilled in fighting, tricky, and manipulative, and takes great pleasure in harming others. He excels at using weaponry and foul play and is one of the few students thus far to have successfully injured Korosensei.\n\nKarma has been described by Karasuma as \"at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but... there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes.\" Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. When fighting, he becomes brutal and has no qualms of hurting people who threatens him or any of his friends from Class E.\n\nIt is also shown that he is one of the most intelligent people in the entire school, shown to be ranked 4th out of all 186 students in Kunigigaoka. He does not, however, want to return to the main building, stating that he finds assassination much more interesting.\n\nRegardless of his lazy personality, Itona has stated that Karma was probably the strongest within the class despite him not excelling in any particular area (shooting, knifework, etc). Most likely this means that Karma prefers to stick to tricks and pranks for assassinations rather than going into full-out combat, and also because of a certain \"vision\" Itona described to Terasaka. It has been mentioned by Karasuma, and proven many times, that Karma likes to humiliate his opponent.\n\nDespite all this, Karma actually has good morales behind his motives. The reason he was placed in Class E was because he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He was, unlike his classmates, unprejudiced against them and still considered the senior a 'senpai'.\n\nHe's also shown to be hardworking when he wants to by studying diligently after the embarrassing exam arc although he hides it by making it look like he was playing video games.\n\n(Source: Assassination Classroom Wikia)"}

He was born in Jiiha Village and was raised by his parents until the age of seven, when his parents were killed in an underground avalanche caused by an earthquake. Their deaths traumatized Simon to the point of both hating and fearing life underground, and likely played a role in developing his relationship with Kamina. Ironically, Simon's role in his community was to dig more tunnels and caverns to expand Jiiha Village deeper underground.\n\nThough valued as a skilled digger, Simon was ignored by the adults of his village and snubbed by the girls, who considered him disgusting. Along with his fear of earthquakes, Simon developed low self-esteem and had many cowardly tendencies. His only friend and role model growing up was Kamina, a brash and eccentric older boy who had an obsession with escaping the underground world for the surface, which he visited as a child with his father. Simon was slowly \"recruited\" into Team Gurren along with several other boys, and lead by Kamina made several attempts to reach the surface over several years. During one attempt, a sudden earthquake trapped Team Gurren within a chamber and cut off the supply of oxygen. Simon began to panic, but after inspiration from Kamina he managed to dig all of the Team Gurren members out of danger. Yoko would later recall that Kamina himself was terrified during this incident, but he hid his fear from Simon knowing Simon was the only one capable of rescuing his gang.\n\nOne day during the digging of a new tunnel, Simon discovers a small drill-shaped object that periodically glows. Later that day, he unearths a large \"face\" in the ground, which he shows to Yoko and Kamina after Jiiha Village is attacked by a large Gunmen. The face is revealed to be a miniature Gunmen, and the object Simon dug up the key to starting it up. With the aid of this mech, which Kamina names \"Lagann.\" Simon destroys the large Gunmen attacking Jiiha and rises to the surface world.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.\n\nNami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels.\n\nShe respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the \"mother\" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word.\n\nNami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target,' as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore."}
{"mal_id": 251, "name": "Haruhi Suzumiya", "description": "Age:15-17\nBirthday: October 8\nHeight: 158 cm (5'2\")\nBlood type: AB\nOccupation: Student (grade 10-11), Ultra Director, Ultra Detective, Brigade Chief and Founder\n\nBackground\nHaruhi Suzumiya, a first year student at North High School (in novels 1-8), and second year (in the 9th and latest novel), can be characterized as funny, eccentric, and somewhat unpredictable. In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for \"ordinary\" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits.\n\nKyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person.\n\nShe is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nAt first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as Mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. She also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when Haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.\n\nHaruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. She has very high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. This can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.\n\nShe is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to Mikuru she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru's attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.\n\n\n\nSOS Brigade role\nHaruhi is the founder and \"Brigade Chief\" of the SOS Brigade, or Saving The World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade. She was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method of finding and recruiting members is to \"voluntarily arrest\" them then force them to join.\n\nThe SOS Brigade is very precious to her and has stated to Kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade's amateur-movie The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina for the school festival."}

He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two thirds god and one third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind's oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu.\n\nHis title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is the king over all heroes. He is mankind's oldest hero, the origin of all myths and model on which heroes are based, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. The heroes of various myths are derived from his legend, so his Gate of Babylon possesses all of their Noble Phantasms. Though there are several heroes holding the title of \"King,\" the King of Knights and King of Conquerors, he is the only one in all of heaven and earth crowned with the title of \"King of All Heroes.\"\n\n\nIn Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA, he's the Heroic Spirit sealed into the eighth Class Card. He manifests as his younger self due to Illya separating him from his shadow form half-way through his incarnation. While initially an adversary, he quickly becomes an ally to fulfill his objectives. Gilgamesh in his child form has a more easygoing attitude compared to his adult self. He asks Illya to call him Gil-kun."}

She can be smart, but she hates studying, thus her grades are a bit uneasy. However, she is an expert in pulling an \"all-nighter.\" In contrast to her studying habits, she loves video games, to the extent that she can compete against Kagami Hiiragi on trivia games (by remembering the question orders, not by knowing the actual answers). In addition, she loves anime, which is also due to her father, Soujirou Izumi's influence, along with the games. He buys ero-games for himself, so she is able to play and enjoy them. In fact, when she became eighteen, Konata was overjoyed, since she could now go buy and play ero-games legally. In the anime, Konata constantly refers to or parodies several popular games, anime, and manga (much to the annoyance of Kagami), but her favorite franchise seems to be the Haruhi series, as she has many Haruhi figurines and decorations that makes her room, and even once went to the Suzumiya Haruhi no Gekisou with her friends. She often gives false information to her family, thus making her father believe that Kagami and Tsukasa are shrine maidens. Interestingly enough, her voice actress for the animated version, Aya Hirano and Wendee Lee, is in fact the same person who voiced Haruhi Suzumiya in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime; other voice actors from the same series make guest appearances during the course of Lucky ☆ Star.\n\nSince she spends quite a large sum of money on video games and doujinshi, Konata was lucky enough to get a part-time job at a cosplay cafe.

District #80 is the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 is the most orderly and law-abiding). While residing in District #80, Kenpachi was nameless. During that time, he became proficient in swordsmanship and killed numerous enemies.\n\nAt some point during his travels outside of District #80, he found a small girl and named her Yachiru (八千流), in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from area #79, Kusajishi (草鹿), where her parents were murdered. The two events were apparently quite close. On that day, he also took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest swordsman, the one who has killed the most. The two developed a father-daughter-like relationship.\n\nAlso, at some point (before he became a Captain), he fought and defeated Ikkaku Madarame; for this reason, Ikkaku pledged to serve under Kenpachi from there on out (Ikkaku doesn't actually get the chance to do so until he joins the 11th Division), but Ikkaku would still jump at the chance to fight Kenpachi to the death.\n\nAfter some time had passed, Kenpachi found his way to the Seireitei. He defeated and killed the previous Captain of the 11th Division (whose identity is currently unknown) and gained his seat in the Gotei 13 in this manner. In the anime, his assumption of the Captain's seat caused Maki Ichinose to leave the Soul Society. According to the anime, it is also what convinced Ikkaku and Yumichika to join the Shinigami.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything.

He is a Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps and the former Flame Hashira.\n\nKyoujurou was a young adult of tall stature and athletic build. He is known have an air of great optimism about him, having an enthusiastic smile plastered on his face nearly all the time. He had long bright yellow hair with red streaks akin to flames along with two shoulder-length bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils.\n\nKyoujurou wore a paler brown version of the regular Demon Slayer uniform, which consisted of a brown gakuran jacket, a white belt around his waist and hakama pants. Over this, he wore a haori with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end that his father Shinjuro once worn and more than likely his father worn when they were the Flame Hashira respectively. Finally, he wore red Kyahan with yellow flames erupting from the bottom-up, with pale brown tabi socks and a pair of white zōri with red straps.\n\nKyoujurou was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He was amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age — the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.\n\nKyoujurou also loved his family immensely, displaying great respect and worry towards his father, Shinjurou Rengoku, despite him growing slowly more aggressive and apathetic towards Kyoujurou. He is incredibly encouraging and optimistic towards his little brother, Senjurou Rengoku, believing in him and wishing him the best no matter what. This is further accentuated during his death where his final words for his father and his little brother were \"take care of your body\" and \"follow your dreams no matter what\". Kyoujurou also believes that if someone lacks immense skill, their hard work towards their dreams and desire to help people doesn't count for nothing.\n\nBeneath his enthusiastic demeanor, Kyoujurou is very logical and tactically intelligent, acting quickly and precisely in battle, especially when the lives of others are on the line. Kyoujurou also is great in seeing talent in others, even in Nezuko, a Demon which he wanted to kill beforehand after seeing her risk her lives to fight Demons. Though he is extremely optimistic, Kyoujurou does sometimes have a sense of foreboding that those he believes in might die, especially his friends which he care deeply for. Lastly, he, like most Demon Slayers, absolutely detest Demons, usually because of their heinous deeds or because of their clashing morale values.\n\nFighting Style:\n\n\nSwordsmanship:\n\n\nEquipment:\n\n\n(Source: Kimetsu no Yaiba Wiki)"}

Before she learned how to play the electric guitar, the only instrument she knew how to play was the castanets. She gets poor grades in school (though when properly coached, she can achieve astounding results), spaces out frequently, and is easily distracted by trivialities (mainly those she deems cute). Yui is a kind and friendly girl who holds no ill-will towards anyone. Yui has shoulder-length, brown hair (a little longer than Ritsu's) which she accessorizes with two yellow hair clips, and brown eyes. She has a huge liking for sweets and consumes them frequently (though she never gains weight, which is greatly envied by Mugi, Mio, and Sawako). She has a younger sister named Ui, who is very mature and acts as the \"older sister\" of Yui, taking care of her while their parents are away on business trips. Despite her difficulties with distractions, Yui works extremely hard to get better at playing guitar. During performances, Yui plays with amazing energy and joy which usually results in great response from the audience.\n\nAs a musician, Yui has absolute pitch—she can tune her guitar perfectly without a tuner, which greatly impresses Azusa, who possesses far more experience with playing guitar than Yui. She has a very easy-going nature, but has incredible focus and retention when she has a clear goal in sight. Yui is still devoted to her band and will always practice hard enough for the club. At school, she has become quite admired for her great voice. However, she has been shown to forget her lyrics mid-performance on at least one occasion and exert herself too much, making her unable to perform sometimes. Mio was the lead vocalist at first, since Yui could not play the guitar and sing at the same time. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters).

Even by his clan's standards, Madara's chakra was especially strong. He grew up constantly competing and training with Izuna and in their efforts to surpass each other, each gained their own Mangekyō Sharingan. With the power of the Mangekyō the two brothers took control of the clan, with Madara as its leader. Under his leadership, the clan conquered all they came across. Because of the never-ending series of battles of the time, Madara eventually began to suffer from overuse of the Mangekyō Sharingan, leaving him blind. In order to regain his sight he took Izuna's eyes for himself, granting him an \"eternal\" Mangekyō Sharingan with which he led the Uchiha clan to prosperity.\n\nOver the years, the Uchiha had constantly fought with the equally powerful Senju clan and as such, Madara had an undying rivalry with Hashirama Senju, the leader of the Senju clan. To bring an end to the constant fighting, Hashirama approached the Uchiha with an offer of peace. Although Madara never wanted peace with the Senju, the rest of the Uchiha wished to end the fighting, and Madara had no choice but to accept. The Senju, the Uchiha, and all the clans they had conquered came together to form the village of Konohagakure.\n\nSome time later, the villagers of Konoha selected Hashirama as the village's first Hokage much to Madara's dismay. Madara feared that Hashirama would oppress the Uchiha, and tried to rally support for challenging his leadership. Rather than help him, the Uchiha turned their backs on him, believing he only desired to rekindle the flames of war.\n\nSoon after being rejected the position of Hokage and being abandoned by his clan, Madara left the village, and sought out Nine-Tails. He later returned in order to challenge Hashirama in battle. They fought at the site that would someday be called the Valley of the End, where Madara was defeated, despite having Nine-Tails at his side. Control of Nine-Tails was ultimately taken from him and Madara died."}

His original name was Shinta (心太).  His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon.  Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.\n\n\nThe next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes.

It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.

Believing her to be of lesser skill than her younger sister, Hanabi Hyuga, her father left Hinata in Kurenai Yuhi's care once she was assigned to Team 8, claiming he didn't care what happened to her. Throughout her early time in Team 8, Hinata's lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to fight hamper her abilities. Although she would train to improve her skills, she would immediately give up when faced with competition and failed every mission she was assigned as a result.\n\n\nHinata has a long-standing crush on Naruto, which has been present since their time in the Academy. Her feelings for him are rooted in his determination, confidence, and strength, all of which Hinata lacks. With her affection for Naruto, Hinata is constantly willing to break away from her normal personality traits in order to help him. She also becomes more assertive for Naruto, and also doesn't hesitate to defend him, even to himself. Her feelings for Naruto are one of the driving forces in her self-improvement, as she tries to gain strength in an attempt to both impress him and become like him. When they meet again in Part II, Hinata is unable to bring herself to greet Naruto and passes out when he comes to greet her, her feelings for him having apparently been amplified during his absence. Despite this, she gradually becomes more comfortable around Naruto, going from being unable to look him in the eye to being able to talk to him, and is able to work with him without difficulty when they are on missions together.\n\nAs a member of the Hyuga clan, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, which gives her an almost 360 field of vision. During the Chunin Exams, she displays the ability to focus the Byakugan's sight, increasing the distance that her eyes can see. She also specializes in the Gentle Fist fighting style, which allows her to damage her opponent's chakra circulatory system and inner organs directly with even a slight tap. In her quest to get stronger, Hinata creates a new ability during the anime's Bikochu arc called Protection of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms (守護八卦六十四掌, Shugohakke Rokujūyon Shō), a combination of the Hyuga clan's most powerful techniques. With it Hinata emits streams of chakra from her palms to create extremely sharp blades that she can use to hit any target in her field of vision. Due to the speed at which these blades move, the amount of control she has over them, as well as her ability to manipulate their size, Hinata can use this technique to attack and defend simultaneously."}

Called the ultimate \"Queen\" by other members. Born between a human mother and fallen angel father, after the death of her mother, she became Rias' servant. She is a friend close enough to call Rias by her name in private, yet calls her Buchou in presence of others and displays a master-servant relationship in public. She persistently refuses to use her power of light, inherited from her father, but starts using it after being convinced by Issei.\n\nShe is first seen to be a very elegant and gentle woman, embodying the principals of the ideal Japanese woman: \"Yamato Nadeshiko\". However underneath her calm atmosphere, she is shown to be highly sadistic in battle and doesn't show any mercy or remorse towards the enemies she slays, casually keeping up her smiling elegant persona over an enemy's death and showing an expression of pleasure and lust upon delivering them pain.\n\nAs a result of seeing her mother be killed in front of her eyes and her father being unable to save her, Akeno developed a hatred for Fallen Angels. She has developed a sense of self-loathing towards her Fallen Angel nature, for it was the reason her was mother killed which led her to sever ties with her father, going into exile before being saved by Rias after Akeno's maternal relatives nearly killed her. Due to this reason, she emphasizes with those who have suffered under the hands of Fallen Angels like Issei and Asia, who were manipulated and killed by the Fallen Angel Raynare as she was worried that Issei would dislike her due to her Fallen Angel nature but fell in love with him after he told her he still liked her. With Issei's help, she was able to overcome the sadness of her mother's death and reconcile with her estranged father, renewing their familial bond. Due to Issei helping her, Akeno's love for him deepened considerably as she confessed her feeling for him.\n\nWhile she originally had no interest in dating men due to her past, she began to take an interest in Issei, thinking of him as a cute junior and that interest intensified after seeing his determination in the Rating Game against Riser Phenex and his actions during Rias' engagement ceremony, where he defeated Riser Phenex. She has stated that Issei is the first boy she has ever felt such feelings for as she is shown to have a desire to further her relationship with him. She also loves to tease Issei and Rias, as she loves to make Rias irritated by flirting with Issei. Akeno has also stated that she has some masochism in her as well, as she is only masochistic towards Issei in contrast to her sadistic nature in battle. She is shown to be quite vulgar, flirting with Issei as such and doesn't care if Rias knows or saw her doing the act as she tried to have sex with him while also trying to help Issei further his relationship with Rias, but does care enough to not steal him away from her as she even helped Issei confess to Rias. After falling in love with him, she becomes very seductive and is obsessed with having an affair with Issei whenever she finds a chance, which is often interrupted by Rias and some others.\n\nShe also has a weak side to her once she removes her mask of being an Onee-Sama, what is left is her true side of \"depending\" on a man which is generally Issei and her father Baraqiel after reconciling with him. If danger arises to them, she will become depressed or it can also lead to a rise in her tension. The latter occurred when Issei was injured in the Rating Game between the Sitri and Gremory groups, and the former when Issei was thought to be dead in the Dimensional Gap.\n\nDespite being seductive toward Issei and acting like a mature young woman, Akeno is still innocent and emotional towards love and acts like a girl her age whenever she is on a date with Issei. However, this still does not stop her being seductive and flirting with Issei. Despite being seen as calm and clear, Akeno does get jealous like the other girls and will fight for Issei. \n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEquipment\n\n\n\n \n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"}

The Yato people are said to have \"transparent\" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands.\n\nShe is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.\n\nKagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.\n\nHer immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.\n\nShe came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.\n\nKagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with \"Gin-chan says...\" or \"Gin-chan told me...\"\n\nKagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura.\n\nShe regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that \"he definitely likes me,\" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.\n\nAlthough Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her \"Anego\" (a term gangster women use to show respect).\n\nHer super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to.\n\nAccording to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.\n\nIn Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.\n\n\nIn the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in the 6th place."}

However, they are also the Queen's watchdogs; the Phantomhive family keeps an eye on black market dealings in ways that Scotland Yard isn't able to. Ciel Phantomhive is the heir to this legacy.\n\nEarl Ciel Phantomhive is the business-savvy, twelve-year-old (later thirteen-year-old) head of the English Phantomhive noble family, taking over after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He also runs Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, and later adds a food branch after winning a Royal Warrant. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eyepatch, bears a pentacle sign of the Faustian contract which binds the demon Sebastian Michaelis to his will. He also has a brand burnt into his back from when he was sold as a slave after his house was burnt down.\n\nCiel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth Midford. He sees her as an important friend and someone he needs to protect. His parents were killed and his mansion was set ablaze on his birthday, a reason why he does not like to celebrate the occasion. This tragedy causes him to not want to lose anyone important again.\n\nDespite his young age, he runs the family company and, as such, is quite busy much of the time though he still finds time to go out investigating dubious legal matters.\n\nThroughout the series Ciel's height has been used as a tool of mockery due to his short stature. He grows by 6 cm in the second season, but still remains shorter than the other characters, thus continuing the comical relief. Sebastian enjoys teasing Ciel about this fact. In the manga, he does not grow taller.\n\nThe young earl is far more composed and mature than would be expected. He remains distant from others, aloof, preferring to spend his time on work for the company.  He is oftentimes selfish and not able to fully empathize with people. However, he does express occasional concern for the well-being of those close to him.\n\nAs a side note, Ciel seems to enjoy drinking tea a lot (he is adept at distinguishing between them as well) and sweet desserts. He has asthma (inherited from his mother) and dislikes being around cats because they trigger his allergies.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

{"mal_id": 8455, "name": "Death the Kid", "description": "Classification: Immortal, Shinigami, Meister\n\nHe is Patricia \"Patti/Patty\" Thompson's and Elizabeth \"Liz\" Thompson's Meister and Death's son. He was born from a fragment of Shinigami's soul.\n\nBeing the son of Shinigami, Kid was singled out. The other students at Shibusen were afraid to get close to him not only because he was Shinigami's son, but because they were afraid that they'd get hurt. This continued until he became the meister of Liz and Patti. They became good comrades, and even helped Kid. Kid didn't, necessarily, experience friendship until he met the others. He is really grateful to have friends that are not afraid of him like the others at Shibusen.\n\nKid has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, or OCPD, which is manifested as an obsession over perfection. Objects and surroundings that are symmetrical can distract him from missions, and he will usually start to break down and have fits if he notices asymmetrical objects around him. Thus if anything is wrong by any measurement (a picture frame crooked, or not folding his toilet paper, for example), he will try to correct it right away, even at the cost of the mission at hand. He is so obsessed with symmetry that Kid refuses to fight a battle unless everything is symmetrical, as he would be asymmetrical holding only one gun. Even if an enemy is symmetrical in appearance, he will refuse to fight it and harm its symmetry. The fact that the left half of his bangs is marked with three white stripes causes him much stress. As a result of his OCPD, Kid can be very hard on himself if the asymmetry of the stripes in his hair are pointed out by someone, calling himself \"useless asymmetrical garbage.\" Kid, trying to make himself completely symmetrical, tried to dye his hair once, but the Sanzu Lines continued to reappear. This is because his reaper body rejects all forms of chemicals and toxins, including artificial coloring like hair dye. The Index of the Book of Eibon referred to this obsession as Madness of Order.\n\nHis favorite number is 8, not only for its symmetry, but for the fact it divides out evenly. An example of one of his fits, and his love for the number 8, can be shown when he met Soul on his first day of DWMA. When Soul said that if Kid had arrived at 7 like he was suppose to he could look around himself. Instead of focusing on the entire comment.. Kid replied, \"No, it can't be seven! Say eight, dammit! Eight is better! It's physically impossible to cut the number seven in half and make it symmetrical! It has to be eight instead! Eight cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! Take it back, I beg of you! Please say eight! Please!\" only to become further distressed when Black Star broke one of the spikes tips jutting out of his fathers, perfectly symmetrical, school.\n\nDespite that his father wears a completely asymmetrical cloak, Kid is not bothered by it at all, being that his love for his father outweighs his OCPD. He also doesn't seem to mind that his Death God Martial Art—\"Stance of Sin\" requires him to hold his arms in asymmetrical position. Showing that there are some things he can tolerate.\n\nHe is usually very mature and precise in his ways. Kid is naturally calm and collected, and as such is perfectly fine with other people making their own decisions when it comes to symmetry or otherwise, even if he disagrees with their choices. However, there are times when his obsession with symmetry can greatly affect his usually calm personality and cause him to break down into childish fits.\n\nDue to his serious personality, Kid is unaffected by nudity. While other male characters get nose bleeds, Kid does not. During a battle with a female \"madness clown\" who was trying to distract Kid with her nearly naked body, Patti says, \"Kid-kun is one of those perverts that gets distracted only when you make him rub your breasts! This won't affect him!\" but isn't actually because he is not a pervert, and is more matured than boys his age. Considering Patti is not the smartest person in the world she would think like this. When Kid had to return to DWMA, in order to get back to the fight on the moon sooner, Kid had no problems walking in the girls bathroom to help, only to be dragged out by Liz. Later in the Death Room, Kid is shown to have blood coming out of one side of his nose and mouth, having been punched by either Liz or Kim.\n\nOf course, Kid's being unaffected by nudity may also be the result of being A-Sexual. Given that his father created both him and Asura A-sexually, and Shinigami shows no interest in either gender, even when Spirit hired Blair and her friends to entertain them during their meeting, he showed no interest and was rather confused by their flirtation and later angry at them for goofing off when they should be discussing the rescue of his son. An example to prove this is when Kid had visited Soul and Maka's apartment, when Blair's towel fell off instead of getting a nosebleed like Soul or Black Star, Kid looked rather disgusted.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have any problem socializing and genuinely cares for his friends. He is seen expressing concern about Soul's scar at one point, and threatens Gopher that he will never forgive him if he hurts Maka after Gopher threatens to hurt her in revenge for their original fight. He also threw Patti and Liz away from him before being sucked into the Book of Eibon, not wanting them to be taken with him.\n\nKid generally seems to be somewhat introverted, often working on missions on his own and not having as close of a friendship with Maka or Black☆Star as Maka and Black☆Star have with each other.\n\nIt is mentioned by Maka that it is normally hard to match soul wavelengths with more than one weapon, but Kid as a highly skilled Meister is able to do so since Liz and Patti have a strong connection with each other and admiration for Kid who gave them a better life.\n\nHis father, Death, has mentioned that Kid is a Shinigami (\"death god\") and does not need to collect souls, but Kid says he wants to make a weapon of his own specifications. His father also says that since he uses two weapons and the guns do not count as a set, he will have to collect twice as many souls: 198 evil human souls and two Witch souls instead of 99 souls and one witch soul. However, he seems perfectly fine with this.\n\nKid shares a side rivalry with Black☆Star, and seems to be stronger, however it is possible that he is more susceptible to madness than Black☆Star or Maka, for both were able to pull themselves from madness while he quickly succumbed to the Madness of Order in the Book of Eibon, while Black☆Star is able to quickly snap himself out of it. This may be because of his OCPD, or simply because of his strong drive to create a perfect world. It is also possible that being a Shinigami, Kid was weaker against the Madness.\n\nAlthough Kid's obsession with symmetry often hinders his performance and focus on missions, he still has good intentions. He wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and help make the world a more peaceful place that is safe from evil."}

{"mal_id": 2072, "name": "Ace Portgas D.", "description": "One of the most obvious features on Ace is his tattoos. Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a \"cross\" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga.\n\nAce has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads \"ASCE\" with the \"S\" (apparently a mistake on the part of the tattoo artist, or, alternatively, the symbol that appeared on the flag of his old crew  crossed out. In the English version of the anime, Ace's shoulder tattoo signifying his name is edited out, as he is referred to there as \"Portgaz D. Trace.\" He appears in One Piece Grand Adventure, once again without the tattoo on his arm.\n\nAce travels around the Grand Line on his boat which is constructed so his Mera Mera no Mi fuels the engine on the rear end allowing it to move.\n\nCurrently, Ace is one of the two known pirates to ever escape arrest by the Marine captain Smoker, the other escapee being Ace's younger brother Luffy. Ace and Smoker fought to a standstill in Alabasta.\n\nHe left Fuusha Village three years before Luffy, and he is a loyal crewman and commands the Second Division of Whitebeard, his captain.\n\nIn appearance, the two brothers are obviously related, despite the fact that Ace is more muscular than the rather lanky Luffy. He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother.\n\nIt is revealed that Ace had a bounty of 550,000,000 in the One Piece Ten exhibition.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind.\" \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port.\"\n\n\nMinato is said to be one of the greatest ninja Konoha has ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He specializes in using the Hiraishin no Jutsu, a technique the Second Hokage, Tobirama created, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash,\" and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact.

But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" — the mark of the Akuma — which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.\n\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. \n\nAbilities\n\nIn addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.\n\nAllen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed  Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (神ノ道化（クラウン・クラウン）, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (神ノ道化, Kami no Douke).\n\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.\n\nWhen facing Tyki yet again, Allen synchronization with his Innocence exceeded 100% which activated his new Crowned Crown ability, Sword of Exorcism. The Sword of Exorcism has the ability to exorcist an Akuma on touch and even the ability to exorcist the Noah Gene from Noah's themselves. What shocked Tyki the most wasn't the ability of the sword but rather the similarity between Allen's Sword of Exorcism and the Millennium Earl's sword.\n\nStory\n\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one."}

His real name is unknown, though Accelerator recalls his surname was composed of two characters and his given name consisted of three characters. First appearing as an antagonist of the third light novel, he later becomes a main character and the lead of the science side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series, especially in volumes 5, 8, 12, 13, SS1, SS2, 15, 14, 19, and 20.\n\nA sadistic boy about the same age as Touma, he has an ability called \"Vector Change,\" a form of telekinesis allowing him to change the vector values of anything he touches due in part of having a thin coat of AIM fields surrounding his body. This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person's body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him.\n\nAccelerator's unique ability made him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 ESPer; according to the city's best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index's Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 ESPer without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to \"level up\" Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 3 ESPers: the Misaka clones. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the most powerful and feared ESPer that no one would be foolish enough to challenge and even killed many who got in his way."}

He begins his story as a new freshman in the town of Morioh. Part 4 begins with Joutarou seeking him out, as Jousuke is the illegitimate son of Joutarou's grandfather, Joseph Joestar.\n\nJousuke makes his entrance into the JoJo universe as a caring, popular, and slightly naïve teenager. Inspired by his police officer grandfather's (on his mother's side) sense of justice, he isn't afraid to fight for those in need. He is confronted by Joutarou with the need to eradicate evil Stand users from his hometown, Morioh. He refuses at first, believing that it is not any of his business. However, he quickly changes his mind when his policeman grandfather is killed by a criminal Stand user. With a vow paralleling that of Peter Parker, Jousuke decides to deliver justice to evil Stand users in his grandfather's place.\n\nJousuke is nice to people and says \"Mister\" and \"Miss\" like a normal, polite young man until someone pisses him off (which isn't very hard to do). The easiest way to do that is to mock his hair, which makes Jousuke angry and explosively violent. Jousuke grew up with his single mother, never knowing his father Joseph Joestar. Jousuke is crafty and has a sneaky streak for money, which is shown multiple times in the story. Nevertheless, he is a dependable and friendly person who is always willing to protect people who need it.\n\nJousuke's Stand power, Crazy Diamond, is a melee Stand with short range (2m). Crazy Diamond has the ability of \"restoration.\" It can repair damage (by returning an object to a previous state) and by extension heal injuries (apart from Jousuke's own injuries). It is limited in that it cannot revive the dead or cure illnesses (as the sick are not considered as damaged). It can, however, restore an item to its raw materials (e.g., a table can be restored to timbers). This ability allows Crazy Diamond to perform a range of interesting feats, including trapping the enemy (by restoring pieces of a broken crate around the target) and tracking (e.g., restoring a torn piece of clothing so that it will seek out what it came from and reattach). Its restoration ability often \"malfunctions\" when Jousuke is angry, causing the object to be improperly put back together. The Stand's name is a reference to Pink Floyd's song, \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond.\""}

He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed \"Nyanko-sensei\" (or simply \"sensei\"), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.\n\nOrphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a \"liar\" and \"attention seeker\" for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively \"normal\" life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.\n\nNatsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.\n \nTo return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process."}

She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she had two personalities: a male personality known as SHIKI, and a female personality known as Shiki. Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the \"yang\" personality, while the female is called the \"yin\" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at any given time because both personalities have a distinct style of speech, most notably seen when the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi, while the male Shiki refers to himself as ore.\n\nAfter awaking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the dead Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the female Shiki's.

He also notes Ichigo's power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own.\n\nIt would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as \"trash,\" which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo's power was so turbulent that eventually he would destroy himself. Grimmjow's conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. Despite Grimmjow's argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra's judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow's unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another.\n\nWhen released his zanpakutou, Murciélago (Japanese for \"giant black-winged demon,\" Spanish for \"bat\"), creates two large black wings on his back.

Renji and Rukia started growing further apart as Renji got further ahead in his training. The emotional distance continued until Rukia was asked to join the Kuchiki family. Renji expressed happiness for Rukia's opportunity but both did not admit that they disagreed with the arrangement since they would likely never see each other again. Rukia reluctantly joined the family and was immediately inducted into the 13th Division without having to graduate or take a squad entrance exam. Unknown to Rukia, Byakuya had adopted her in order to fulfill the last wish of Hisana, whom he had taken as his wife.\n\nIn the 13th Division, Rukia was not given a seat position, due to Byakuya Kuchiki's influence, since he did not want her sent on dangerous missions. She became friends with the division lieutenant, Kaien Shiba, who trained and mentored her. Their first training location was Mount Koifushi of Hokutan, the 3rd district of West Rukongai.\n\nRukia greatly admired Kaien's wife, 3rd Seat Miyako Shiba. When Miyako was killed by a hollow, Rukia, Kaien, and the division's captain, Jūshirō Ukitake hunted the hollow down. Kaien faced the hollow alone but the hollow's special ability destroyed his zanpakutō. Rukia attempted to draw her sword and help but was stopped by Ukitake. He told her that Kaien's fight was one of honor rather than a fight for his life. If Rukia helped, Kaien would be saved but his honor would be damaged forever. Meanwhile, the hollow entered Kaien and possessed him. Ukitake faced the hollow but his illness allowed the hollow the opportunity to attack Rukia. Kaien momentarily regained control and thrust himself through Rukia's zanpakutō. He thanked Rukia and Ukitake for letting him fight for his honor and died in Rukia's arms. Rukia brought the corpse to the Shiba family but was afraid to apologize since she felt guilty about her role in Kaien's death.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

{"mal_id": 2, "name": "Faye Valentine", "description": "Birthday: August 14, 1994\n\nOne of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\n\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.\n\n\nThroughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the “only place I could return to”. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong."}

{"mal_id": 1533, "name": "Kotarou Katsura", "description": "Age: 20s\nBirthday: June 26 (Cancer)\nHeight: 175 cm\nWeight: 56 kg\nBlood Type: AB\n\nKatsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.\n\nKatsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the \"Daybreak of the Joui Faction\" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.\nSince he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura.'\n\nKatsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).\nKatsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.\n\nIn the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him \"Zura.\" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him \"Casserole,\" or \"Cough syrup.\" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura \"Zura.\" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies \"Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!\" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies \"Not Casserole! It's Katsura!\" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since \"Katsura\" can mean wig in Japanese and \"Zura\" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since \"Katsura\" and \"Casserole\" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.\n\nHis name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."}

His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan.\n\nAt first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy.\n\nIn spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory. \n\n(Source: Hoopedia)"}

He has around half a dozen small bangs which he doesn't keep spiked. Instead of wearing the school-issued blue uniform of Sarayashiki Junior High, he wears a identically-designed green uniform. He does this in direct rebellion of the school's strict dress code. Throughout the series, Yuusuke's clothing changes, but he usually wears some type of fighter's garb. Yuusuke looks rather-skinny, a stark contrast to his unusual strength. At the beginning of the series, he was also quite short as seen when Keiko points out he was shorter than she was.\n\nHaving no father and with his mother always off somewhere else, getting drunk or partying, Yuusuke has grown up in a very neglectful environment. He's short tempered, impulsive, and likes to intimidate those who are afraid of him. One of his most notable traits is his desire to fight, which becomes more noticeable as the series progresses. Yuusuke has been noted on many occasions to being rather unintelligent and, at times, just plain stupid. Yuusuke's desire to fight is more out of enjoyment of a good brawl, and surprisingly Yuusuke doesn't like killing if he can avoid it.\n\nEven though Yuusuke is feared by most students; and severely disliked by almost all of the teachers, he is generally misunderstood. Keiko Yukimura is one of the very few who knows Yuusuke is actually very kind, and she sympathizes with his problems in life.

Yuusuke initially didn't like Kuwabara, but as the series progresses, the two develop a mutual bond and respect for each other, with Kuwabara being the only person who truly understands him. Yuusuke and Hiei have a serious rivalry and, at times, Yuusuke seems almost intimidated by Hiei's remarkable skills. Yet, each of them has respect for the other, and will put their lives on the line to help one another. Yuusuke is very close to Kurama and has a great amount of confidence in him.

Though she tells Happy she considered joining Fairy Tail's rival guild, Phantom Lord, due to their similar outrageous nature and personality, she is content with her decision of joining Fairy Tail. After being rescued by Natsu from the slave ship, she is invited to join the guild. Once joining Fairy Tail, Lucy becomes a member of Natsu's team.\n\nLucy is one of the saner and more stable members of Fairy Tail, having common sense that other members of the guild seem to lack.

Lucy explains to Natsu that Stellar Spirit mages have the potential to obtain extremely rare Gold Keys, which open the gates of the \"Ecliptic Zodiac\", and common, store-bought Silver keys. Each gold key has the Zodiac symbol of the one it is used to summon on it. According to Lucy, while there is a large number of silver keys, there are only 12 gold keys.

She also summoned all of her Gold keys (5 of them at the time) and Plue at once, although it only lasted a few seconds, it showed her to be very powerful.

At an early age, he acquired an obsessive interest in video games; now he is known as \"The Capturing God (落とし神, Otoshi-gami?)\" in the gaming world for his legendary skills in \"capturing\" any girls in dating sims. But ironically, he is called otamegane (a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku and megane-\"glasses\") by almost everyone in his school due to his extreme devotion to videogames. Despite himself saying he likes girls, it's the perfectly theoretical and beautiful girls of the game world that he prefers, not the girls in reality. His love for games is such that he even goes into withdrawal if he doesn't play games enough and he has the bad habit of locking himself in his room and playing games for days on end when he's depressed.\n\nAt the start of the series, Keima becomes a collaborator for catching runaway spirits when he replies to an instigative e-mail to his mail address in his PFP (otoshi-god@zumcities.co.jp) requesting his help to \"capture\" girls without knowing it was a contract from Hell, to which Elsee appeared and asked for his aid to \"capture\" girls in real-life. For each individual of the \"Capture Targets\"—a girl with the runaway spirit in her—Keima utilizes his analytical skills and experiences from dating sims to \"capture\" them. When he has figured out the final push needed to \"capture\" a girl (in both reality and games), he says the catchphrase \"I can already see the ending.\" Whenever he isn't capturing runaway spirits, he is almost always seen playing video games on his PFP (a parody of Sony's PSP), which might explain his weak physique.\n\nAlso, despite the fact he even plays video games in class, he is still at the top of class in every subject. During a scolding of a teacher for his gaming habits, Keima reasoned that all would be fine as long as he aced all his exams; he then proceeded to do so, demonstrating a great academic ability. It is shown that Keima's analytical skills he utilises to \"capture\" girls is also applied by him in his studies, proven true when he flawlessly predicted the questions on the upcoming English test based on the teacher's personality and the examination extent. As the story progresses, his perspective of the \"real world\" girls becomes different. Nevertheless, he remains faithful to his \"2D girls,\" in particular, a girl named \"Yokkyun\" who seems to be drawn in a parody style of famed visual novel Kanon.\n\nHis mastery and devotion to girl games was revealed to be way higher above than just average otakus. He is able to play six games at the same time with each of different screens with the activation of his \"Capturing God Mode.\" His PFP breaks numerous times during the series, but later found that he actually has a lot of spare PFP hidden around his body.

{"mal_id": 1742, "name": "Conan Edogawa", "description": "Age: 6-7 (as Conan); 17 (as Shinichi)\nHeight: Unknown (as Conan); 174 cm (as Shinichi)\nWeight: 18 kg (as Conan)\nDate of Birth: May 4\nRelatives: Yuusaku Kudou (father) &amp; Yukiko Kudou (mother)\nNicknames: Cool Kid (Jodie Starling), Cool Guy (Vermouth), Silver Bullet-kun (Vermouth), Glasses Kid (Sonoko Suzuki), Holmes' Apprentice (Apollo &amp; Minerva Glass)\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Shinichi Kudou is a 17-year-old student at Teitan High School. He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the \"Savior of the police force,\" for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investigating two mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6-year-old.\n\nShinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's who places Conan in Ran's care. Ran's father Mouri Kogorou, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.\n\nAs Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogorou's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogorou's reputation who will later on be referred to as \"Sleeping Kogorou.\" He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.\n\nConan remains very close to Ran, who in return is very protective of him. However, because Ran is unaware of his true identity, Conan often finds himself in awkward situations with her, such as when she confessed her feeling for Shinichi to him and when she made him bathe with her at a hot spring.\n\nConan's intelligence remains intact even though he has shrunken into a child. As Shinichi, his deductive ability earned him the monikers \"Heisei Holmes\" and \"Savior of the Japanese police force.\" Conan maintains an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases and escape tricky situations. Conan tries to speak in a child-like manner when dealing with adults, but he often gets caught up in the current case and begins speaking like an adult, referring to advanced topics and using reasoning much too complex for a normal child. When this happens, he often tries to pass it off as \"something [he] heard on TV\" or \"taught by uncle Kogoro/professor Agasa/Shinichi-niichan.\"\n\n\nLikewise, he makes no effort to hide his love for Sherlock Holmes and soccer, so if he called out for talking about either subject in too much detail, he tries to escape suspicion by saying it was something Shinichi told him about. Although as the series has progressed the adults around him have become more used to his \"being quite smart for a child,\" causing him to behave more like himself around them, he still tries to pass as a normal child. The only police officers with whom Conan can speak in a professional manner are the FBI, especially Jodie Starling, Shuichi Akai, James Black, and Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Police, all of whom suspect that there is more to Conan than meets the eye.\n\nConan tends to act more like himself around the Detective Boys, even to the point that they find it odd when he acts like a child around adults. He will often play games like baseball with the Detective Boys, but he is too used to soccer to perform well and will even instinctively use soccer techniques, such as kicking in games that do not call for it. Because he is unfamiliar with popular games and TV shows, and bad at video games, Genta and the others tend to think of him as dumb. This annoys Conan so much that he will secretly watch TV in the living room after Kogoro and Ran go to sleep to get more \"practice\" in.\n\n(Source: Detectiveconanworld.com)"}

He wields the Tessaiga (known as the \"Tetsusaiga\" in the Viz translation), a supernatural sword made from one of his deceased father's fangs. This sword, when properly wielded, can destroy one hundred demons with a single swing, and has further powers which are revealed as the story progresses. It is also a source of which hatred exists between Inuyasha and his brother Sesshomaru, a full youkai dog demon, being that Inuyasha can wield the Tessaiga and Sesshomaru can not. Inuyasha has a tendency for massive regeneration and can recover from injuries which would be fatal for any average human. This ability is likely derived from his youkai powers (Example: Episode 5, when Kagome brings medicine from her time).

{"mal_id": 1358, "name": "Sesshoumaru", "description": "Inuyasha's older half-brother. Unlike Inuyasha, Sesshoumaru is a full-blooded dog-demon and is contemptuous of InuYasha for being a half-demon and for consorting with humans. He is a very powerful demon who seems to have no true equal when it comes to raw power; although given the chance in volume twenty-three, he could not defeat Naraku. Although fandom refers to him as the Lord of the Western Lands, this title appears at no point in the manga. Takahashi also stated that Sesshoumaru has no permanent home. Unlike almost every other demon in the world of InuYasha, he has no interest in possessing even one shard of the Shikon Jewel.\n\nSesshoumaru first appears in search of the sword called Tessaiga, created from their father Inu-no-Taisho's fang, which has the power to kill a hundred yōkai with one swing; however, Inu-no-Taisho left Tessaiga to Inuyasha, and Sesshoumaru instead inherited the Tenseiga, a sword which cannot harm the living, but can bring the dead back to life. Inu-no-Taisho did this in the hopes that Sesshoumaru would learn compassion. Considering Tenseiga useless to him, Sesshoumaru battles Inuyasha several times for possession of Tessaiga, and when Tessaiga is broken by a bite from Naraku's incarnation Goshinki, Sesshoumaru has Goshinki's fangs forged into the evil blade Tokijin, which only he is powerful enough to control.

She also has dark brown pupils and a fair complexion. Because of the effects of being a Flame Haze, Shana's body age remains that of a girl of 11 to 12 years old. Upon invoking her powers as a Flame Haze, her hair and eyes change color to a fiery crimson, with embers fluttering from her head down.\n\nIn her first few years as a Flame Haze, she wears an all-black attire consisting of a shirt, pants, and her Treasure Tool Yogasa in the form of a trench coat. However, after she decided to stay in Misaki City, she is most usually seen with the Misaki City Municipal High School uniform and when in combat, has the Yogasa as a cape worn over her clothes.\n\nShe is later seen wearing a red-and-black frilly dress on her stay inside the Seireiden.\n\nInitially, she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, not even considering getting a name as she didn't see any importance having it. She sees Yuuji only as a Torch, an object, albeit marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. However, she slowly opens up to Yuuji, coming to think of him as a person despite being a Torch and eventually, comes to show affection to him. Her duty made her indifferent toward human life at first, but through Yuuji's influence, Shana has opened up slightly, although she still remains confused and disgruntled by some human traits which she considers as pointless, although some of it is used to mask her jealousy of her desired monopoly on Yuuji.\n\nShana has a habit of saying \"Urusai! Urusai! Urusai!\" (\"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!\") whenever Yuuji asks her questions or makes remarks that disturb her original worldview or embarrass her. But in reality they really care for each other. She has a great fondness for anything sweet, eventually putting melon bread above her preference.\n\nShana is shown to be highly intelligent as she has gotten a perfect score on every exam and is talented in Physical Education. She is shown, however, to be naive when it comes to social affairs, once even unabashfully asking Chigusa, \"How are babies made?\"\n\nKnown only as the \"Flaming-Haired, Blazing-Eyed Hunter,\" Shana bears no name until she meets Yuuji, who names her after the sword she wields. As a \"Flame Haze,\" Shana is sworn to protect the balance of the world by hunting down the \"Guze no Tomogara,\" monsters from the \"Crimson Realm\" who come to earth in order to harvest the \"Power of Existence\" from its denizens. Together with Alastor, \"Flame of the Heavens\" and Shana's guide who lives within her and speaks to her through a necklace she wears, she has become one of the most powerful Flame Haze in existence.\n\nShana is said to be the most powerful, known and feared by most Crimson Denizens with her title alone. This has allowed her to defeat many powerful Denizens and permits her many different abilities, including her proficiency with the Nietono no Shana, the ability to wield flames, manipulate the Power of Existence, harbor extrasensory traits, and fly with wings of flame. In the third volume of the manga, the first volume of the novel, and the movie, Alastor states that the reason why she did not explode after being shot by Friagne's Trigger Happy was because she held a capacity that existed in dimensional space, who was able to contain the Flame of Heaven's (and more); he has thus stated her as \"The Great One.\"\n\n\nHowever, she demonstrates a clear lack of experience in battle, as noted by Sophie Sawallisch, who has witnessed her fighting style first-hand. This is once responsible for her defeat against Flame Haze Margery Daw, who is a specialist in Power of Unrestraint.\n\n\nDespite being the title character of the anime, Shana has few character relations with many of the characters in the show. That would be because of the manner she was raised. Wilhelmina, Shiro, and Alastor mostly focused on her physical and mental being, forgetting that being as socially adept is as important. This was, as Alastor said, one of their mistakes, since they thought that they would just teach her these feelings when she grows up a little more, not realizing that these feelings should be developed and could not be taught so hastily. (Although, Shiro did teach her indirectly that love is the most powerful unrestricted spell of all.)\n\nHer main social interest is Yuuji, whom she sees as her love interest. Her relationship with Yuuji is one of the driving forces of the series. Shana takes orders and advice from the Crimson Lord she is bound to, Alastor, and has a mentor and guardian in the form of Wilhelmina Carmel. Kazumi Yoshida is her love-rival for Yuuji, and Shana treats her with contempt and disdain. She generally treats most other characters with ignorance and indifference, with the exception of Chigusa Sakai, who she looks to as a source in answering certain difficulties when Alastor or Wilhelmina are unable to do so. Shana eventually starts to be more open to the other characters, especially in regards to her relationship with Kazumi becoming more friendly.\n\nAfter meeting Yuuji, Shana goes through a chaotic phase in she experiences new emotions like love, jealousy, hatred, and loneliness.

She plays a Fender Mustang MG69/MH/CAR electric guitar which she eventually names Muttan, but is also in possession of a Gibson Les Paul Custom 50th Anniversary Gold Top (as seen in episode 13). She is a self-proclaimed novice guitarist who has been playing the guitar since the fourth grade and whose parents play in a jazz band. She is in the same year and class as Yui's sister, Ui, and has quite a mysterious demeanor. She often finds herself bewildered by the tea parties and cosplaying aspects of the club when she would rather just practice, and is struck by how good the club's music sounds despite their problems and lack of practice. However, she has a certain weakness for cakes and can be calmed down rather easily, sometimes by just being petted. She is more serious than the other girls, and does not like to admit how she really feels; she could be described in part as a tsundere. She is constantly hugged by Yui and is nicknamed Azu-nyan after trying on a pair of cat ears and meowing.\n\nIn the band, she looks up to Mio the most due to her maturity and the fact that she is an experienced musician, even trying to give Mio chocolate on Valentine's Day. However, she sometimes unintentionally makes remarks concerning Mio's weaknesses, such as her weight. She also finds Mugi very beautiful, and envies her hair and large eyes, and later starts teaching her how to play guitar when the two are alone in the club room. Since joining, Yui comes to her for advice on playing guitar, as well as maintenance. She gets a tan extremely easily, once during their time at the beach and another during a music festival (even after applying sunscreen). As a result, she frequently gets sunburned as well. She gets lonely very easily, and often worries that everyone in the club will leave her, as they are one-year-older and eventually will graduate. Due to this, the rest of the girls buy her a turtle to look after, naming it Ton-chan.\n\nShe is interested in a wide range of genres without limiting herself to anything in particular. She started playing instruments in fourth grade of elementary school, which makes it about 5 years of experience. Her parents both play in a jazz band.\n\nOutside of the band, she often hangs out with Ui and Jun whenever the other girls are busy. When the others graduate, she becomes the new Light Music Club president alongside Ui and Jun, who decide to join her. Together with two new members, Sumire and Nao, they form a new band called Wakaba Girls. During the Wakaba Girls' first summer training camp Azusa reveals to Sawako her belief that she is unable to act like a proper president for the Light Music Club; however, Sawako suggests that there is no proper way to define what it means to be a president and that Azusa will do just fine. While on that same training camp Azusa is convinced by the others to become the band's vocalist despite her prior reservations on the issue, and eventually overcomes her weakness to sing in the school festival.\n\nHer preference in clothing includes pants over skirts. Short pants are among the things she likes to wear. Her room is very tidy and not excessively cute.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, K-On! Wiki, Blu-ray book page)"}
{"mal_id": 907, "name": "Byakuya Kuchiki", "description": "Occupation: Shinigami Captain of the 6th Division\nBirthday: January 31 (Aquarius)\nHeight: 180 cm (5' 11\")\nWeight: 64 kg (141 lbs)\nZanpakutou: Senbonzakura\nTitle: 28th Head of the Kuchiki Clan\nKnown Relatives: Hisana Kuchiki (wife), Rukia Kuchiki (sister), Ginrei Kuchiki (grandfather), Sojun Kuchiki (father)\nLikes: Chinese bellflowers, night time walks, spicy food\nTheme Song: \"Je Chante Pour Passer le Temps\" by Giovanni Mirabassi\n\nByakuya Kuchiki is the captain of the 6th Division in the Gotei 13. His lieutenant is Renji Abarai. He is the 28th head of the noble Kuchiki clan, one of the four noble families in Soul Society. As such, Byakuya acts in an aristocratic manner: he is always quiet and apathetic towards other people.\n\nHe claims that life in general isn't supposed to be entertaining, and in one of the omake chapters, he even makes up an idea for a game that isn't meant to be amusing. In spite of his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him.\n\nByakuya is popular among the female shinigami of Soul Society, and was voted number one in the \"captain we desire to release a photo book for\" poll taken by the Shinigami Women's Association.\n\nByakuya wears the standard captain uniform along with a white headpiece called a kenseikan (symbolizing his noble rank as the head of the Kuchiki family) and a white scarf made by the master weaver, Tsujishirō Kuroemon III. The scarf is made from silver-white windflower light silk (ginpaku kazahana no uzuginu) and is a family heirloom handed down through the generations to the head of the Kuchiki family.\n\nLittle is known about Byakuya's early history, except that he often played tag with Yoruichi Shihouin using flash steps, though he never was able to beat her, a score that upholds to the current time of the series.\n\nByakuya married Hisana, who was then a commoner; therefore, he broke the rules by accepting her into the noble Kuchiki family. Shortly before her death, Hisana asked Byakuya to find and adopt her biological sister, Rukia, whom she had abandoned as a baby. She also made him promise that he would not tell Rukia about her real family, for she believed that by abandoning Rukia when she was younger she was not worthy to be called her sister.\n\nOne year later, Rukia entered the shinigami academy; shortly after, Byakuya found her and immediately adopted her into the Kuchiki clan. By adopting her Byakuya respected his wife's last wish, but had broken the rules of his clan again. He later swore upon his parents' graves that he would never break the rules again, no matter what. As a result, he, though entirely apathetic on the surface, is actually deeply conflicted with the matter of Rukia's execution: should he intervene, it would require breaking the promise to his parents and the rules again, but should he do nothing he would fail to fulfill the promise he made to Hisana to protect Rukia as his own sister.\n\nWhile it is not clear, it is implied that Byakuya Kuchiki became captain of the 6th division less than 50 years before the main Bleach storyline (shortly before Rukia had entered the Gotei 13). Gin Ichimaru became captain of the 3rd Division at the same time.\n\nByakuya Kuchiki's zanpakutou is Senbonzakura (千本桜, A Thousand Cherry Blossoms). Its shikai is triggered by the command \"scatter\" (散れ, chire). In its shikai, Senbonzakura's blade scatters into a thousand tiny blades. While the blades are supposedly too small to see normally, they appear as cherry blossoms because of the way the light shines on them. Byakuya can control the blades at will, allowing him to shred opponents at a distance and break through almost any defense. While Byakuya can control the blades with his mind alone, using his hands allows him to do so more effectively, making the blades move almost twice as fast.\n\nByakuya's bankai, named Senbonzakura Kageyoshi (Vibrant Display of the Thousand Cherry Blossoms), is essentially a much larger version of Senbonzakura's shikai. To activate it, Byakuya drops his sword. The sword passes through the ground and two rows of giant blades rise up from the ground behind Byakuya. These then scatter into a million tiny blades. The number of blades is great enough that Byakuya can use them for defense as well as offense.\n\nByakuya's bankai has two extra forms, achieved by arranging the blades in different patterns. They are activated by saying the name of the technique followed by the name of his bankai. The first is \"scene of a massacre\" (senkei, Viz: \"annihilate\"), which unites the scattered petals into complete swords that form four rows around Byakuya and his opponent. While Byakuya can control these swords as he does his regular blades, he usually attacks with just one in hand. After immobilizing an opponent, he can call in the other blades to hit them while they're trapped. He can also use all the blades at once for one immensely powerful strike. The second form is \"final scene\" (shuukei, Viz: \"last sight\"), which condenses every tiny blade into a single sword to drastically increase its cutting power. The blade appears bright white, earning it the name \"white imperial sword\" (白帝剣, hakuteiken, Viz: \"white emperor sword\"). Byakuya also grows pure white wings and a halo-like circle in the back, both made of spiritual power. In the anime, dragon-like beings sprout out of Senbonzakura to create the wings. It is unknown whether these wings are merely a cosmetic effect or if they can be used to fly.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

She goes to an offline meet-up where she meets both Saori and Kirino in person. Like Kirino, she remains aloof during this meeting, and it isn't until after the meeting at Saori's post-gathering that she is formally introduced. Kuroneko is a fan of teenage fantasy anime and is sickened by cute anime, like Meruru. Naturally, this precipitates several arguments between Kirino and her, but they still manage to maintain a friendship despite their differences. Kuroneko is shown to care greatly for her friends despite her cold attitude towards people of “the mortal world.”\n\nKuroneko is known for her dark clothing and scarlet eyes. She cosplays daily in gothic lolita clothing similar to those worn on her favorite anime, Maschera ~Lamentation of the Fallen~. However, it is revealed that scarlet isn't her real eye color; she just wears contacts (her real irises are lavender). She writes doujinshi and novels, but none of her works are popular. Kuroneko is very intelligent and has a large vocabulary, making her works too sophisticated for the average reader."}

This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end.\n\nFranky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.\n\nFranky is quick to defend other people (e.g. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D.

{"mal_id": 1080, "name": "Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez", "description": "Race: Arrancar\nGender: male\nHeight: 186 cm\nWeight: 80 kg\nAffiliation: The Espada\nRank: #6\n\nDate of birth: July 31st\nZodiac sign: Leo\nHole location: Abdomen (腹部)\n\nGrimmjow has light blue hair, and his eyes have blue/green lines below them that are similar to the red marks on Ikkaku Madarame's eyes. Grimmjow's attire consists of a white hakama and a black sash, his white jacket is ragged and consists of an upturned collar, with black inner lining, the sleeves are rolled and Grimmjow wears it open; chest revealed. The remains of his jawbone like hollow mask are relegated to his right cheek, and his hollow hole has moved to his abdomen.\n\nGrimmjow appears to be a laid back and irreverent individual, but this scruffy appearance hides an impulsive, excessively violent personality and a lethally short temper. Grimmjow is blunt, rude, and quite sadistic, revealing an insane grin in battle, much like Kenpachi Zaraki. Grimmjow has little respect for authority and says whatever is on his mind, regardless of whether or not it is appropriate. This attitude leads to conflicts with Kaname Tōsen, who holds Grimmjow in the same low regard as he did Zaraki. He also has conflicts with Ulquiorra Schiffer, the 4th Espada, usually because Ulquiorra interrupts his fights or doesn't act on his own impulses. He has also developed a grudge against Ichigo Kurosaki for wounding him during their second fight, and is eager to return the favor. He purposefully kept the large scar on his chest from their first battle as a reminder of this.\n\nGrimmjow is the sixth Espada in Sōsuke Aizen's army of arrancar, meaning he is ranked sixth in terms of strength. Grimmjow was the first character to be revealed as an Espada in the series. A crooked number 6 is tattooed on his back just above and to the right of his hollow hole. Aizen personally marks the Espada, the ten most powerful of his arrancar, with such tattoos as visible marks of their rank and ability. After Kaname Tōsen cuts off and burns his arm, Grimmjow is demoted and quickly replaced by Luppi, much to his annoyance. After Orihime Inoue heals his arm, he kills Luppi to regain his rank, impaling him on his newly restored arm and then vaporizing Luppi's torso with a cero blast.\n\nWhen his zanpakutō, Pantera (豹王（パンテラ, Spanish for \"panther,\" Japanese for \"panther king\") is released he regains some of his former feline characteristics such as jagged teeth, feline ears, clawed hands and feet, and a tail that can be used as a powerful whip.This state augments his speed drastically and gives him animal-like agility and movements to match. His roar can create shockwaves in the air, he can also fire a number of largely destructive \"darts\" from his elbows and create energy claws called Desgarrón (豹王の爪（デスガロン, Spanish for \"laceration,\" Japanese for \"panther king's claw\") from his fingertips.\n\nGrimmjow's character design draws heavily from a character in Tite Kubo's earlier manga, Zombie Powder. The main character of the series, Gamma Akutabi, shares both the bone-like jaw structure and lost arm with Grimmjow, although Gamma wears mechanical prosthetics to cover his disfigurements. Grimmjow's released form makes the resemblance even more apparent. The two have also been identically posed for volume covers.\n\nTheme song: \"Bomb LA(A Bombs) - Step Inside\" from [And Just Constantly Rotating]\n\n(Source: Bleach official character books I-III)"}

She is being treasured as the only daughter.\nDwelling: Single-family home, a rather stately mansion.\nCommute to school: By train (she lives two train stops away from the school). Because being driven to and from school by car is embarrassing for her, she avoids it.\nPreferences in clothing: Skirts over pants. High society lady styles, such as elegant one piece dresses.\nHer room: Canopy bed, antique furniture and such, as expected of a rich girl's room. The room is decorated mostly according to her parents' tastes.\nFavorite food: She prefers traditional sweets such as daifuku (rice cakes with red bean jam filling) because she worries about calories and because western sweets are brought to her house all the time and she is tired of them.\nSubjects she is good at: If anything, humanities, though she is also above average at science and math. While she is a little weaker than Mio when it comes to math, her math skills are certainly above her grade level.\nSubjects she is bad at: No subject in particular.\nPhysical activity: Tsumugi is gentle and quiet and as result she is not good at ball games and track-and-field athletics. However, she has a lot of arm strength and amazing hand grip. She is a very strong girl.\nWay to pass the time when alone: Elegant teatime\nWeaknesses and dislikes: She is a little worried about her predisposition to gain weight easily.\n\n    Tsumugi, often referred to as 'Mugi' by her friends, is a wealthy girl with a gentle and sweet personality who plays a Korg Triton Extreme 76-key keyboard, though she is also seen playing a Korg RK-100 keytar in the closing credits of the first season. She originally intended to join the choir club, but joins the light music club instead after receiving an invitation and encouragement from both Mio and Ritsu.Tsumugi is considered a piano prodigy since she has been playing the piano since she was four and has experience in winning various piano contests. Mugi has long, pale blonde hair, blue eyes, unusually large eyebrows, which apparently run in her family and a fair complexion that the other characters do not have, but she does not get sunburned. She is the daughter of a company president, and her family has several villas in various places around Japan (and even one in Finland). Since her father also owns a maid café, she often brings confectionery and an assortment of sweets and pastries to the club room, and she diligently makes tea with a tea set which is kept in their club room. Despite her wealth, she is fascinated by and finds joy in \"normal\" activities, such as ordering fast food, sharing french fries with her club mates, holding down part-time jobs and haggling over prices. Tsumugi displays a rebellious streak occasionally, diverting from her normally well-behaved and mature demeanor to the surprise of the others. She also displays a childlike eagerness from time to time, and possesses unusually high strength, being able to effortlessly carry around her own keyboard, Ritsu's drums, amplifiers, and at one point beating an arm-wrestling game in an arcade.\n\n    Tsumugi is often entranced by the sight of two girls interacting closely together, sometimes imagining something more risqué in her head. The series sometimes indicates that Mugi has a crush on their teacher, Sawako Yamanaka. While a lot of things do not bother her, she is fairly conscious about her weight (just like Mio), and she gets a bit anxious when her family's staff start spoiling her friends during villa visits. She later begins learning how to play the guitar from Azusa. Tsumugi has a childhood friend several years younger than her named Sumire Saitō who is a daughter of the family that serves the Kotobuki household. Tsumugi grew up home schooled, and therefore spent very little time in the outside world. Because of their close friendship Sumire would purchase everyday items like manga for Tsumugi that she was not normally allowed to see. Tsumugi was rather taken by some of the yuri manga she received which may have influenced her later perceptions about relationships. When Sumire started high school, Tsumugi wanted her to experience the light music club on her own, but due to Sumire's shyness Tsumugi came up with the excuse to send her to the club room to pick up the tea sets that had been left there and told Sawako when Sumire did join that it was okay to leave the tea sets there.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

He rarely shows emotion. His best friend is Itsuki Takeuchi, who is a racing fan.\n\nTakumi works part-time at a gas station with Itsuki, along with Iketani, who is a member of the local racing team, the Akina Speed Stars. In the first few episodes both Itsuki and Iketani think that Takumi has no driving ability because of Takumi's total disinterest in cars and racing.\n\nThe only one who suspects that Takumi has an advanced driving technique is the owner of the gas station, Yuuichi, as seen in the episode where Takumi discusses drifting technique with Iketani and Itsuki. In fact, Takumi has far more experience on the touge than Iketani and Itsuki, as Takumi has been driving his father's AE86 Trueno for five years (since he was 13 in his first year of junior high school, 7th grade), delivering tofu to a hotel at 4 a.m. every day. Takumi has been manipulated subtly by Bunta into developing driving skills, without being fully aware of Bunta's intent.\n\nBunta aside, Takumi's driving technique is the best on Akina; the very fact that he has managed to win races against far more powerful cars with his AE86 Trueno is testament to his driving skills. As a result of constant everyday practice and over 5 years of experience on Akina, Takumi is able to adapt to nearly any situation that presents itself during a race with astonishing speed. One factor in his nearly unparalleled driving skills is his ability to visualize the road in his head, thus making up for the lack of visibility no matter how dark the mountain pass may be. He is an instinctive rather than an intellectual driver. Although the mizutoshi technique is a great but difficult technique that his father taught him, it lead him to many victories through out the story.\n\n\nTakumi looks docile and weak minded, but he is stubborn and strong-willed, many remarks are said about that. Yuuichi figure out he was like his father in his behavior. However, to those who have raced against him, Takumi possesses tremendous concentration and instinctive insight once behind the wheel (and these qualities are most evident when he is chasing after his opponent). His apparent docility became traps for many opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

Grell explains that the scythe is capable of cutting through anything; when it cuts through a person, it divides their soul and their memories, thus resulting in that person's memories playing before their eyes."}

In 2006, Suguru's hair was much shorter as a student, most of it tied up but his bangs were still as prominent. After August 2007 when Suguru became a curse user, his hair began to grow longer and reflect the length it is in 2017.  As a student, Suguru wore a normal jujutsu high uniform. While masquerading himself under the facade of a Buddhist priest, Suguru dons the appropriate attire. He sports a gold-colored kāṣāya garment over black yukata robes. His monk attire is completed with white tabi socks and zōri sandals.\n\nSuguru Geto hated non-sorcerers, usually referring to them as \"monkeys.\" He felt sorcerers are the superior race and humanity's next stage of evolution. He was smug and extremely condescending towards normal humans, using fake personas to lure in vulnerable people who were cursed. Suguru found non-sorcerers disgusting enough to spray himself in order to disinfect the \"monkey stench.\" He believed monkeys only have two roles in association with him, money-collecting monkeys and curse-collecting monkeys. If they weren't fulfilling their roles, Suguru would gladly allow curses to kill them without any remorse.\n\n\n\n(Source: Jujustu Kaisen Wiki)"}

After losing a game of One Outs for the first time to the Lycaons' cleanup batter (Hiromichi Kojima), he joins the Lycaons team with an odd contract – the “One Outs Contract” – that decides Toua's pay based on his performance.\n\nArguably, the most fearsome trait of Tokuchi is his perceptive intellect, which he uses to manipulate professional baseball. As a baseball pitcher, he psychologically manipulates and intimidates the batters he faces along with playing high-stakes psychological and intellectual battles against his own antagonistic team owner, competing team coaches, and underhanded opposing teams. As the Lycaons' famed star pitcher, he can pitch entire games without giving up a single hit.\n\nTokuchi's most important skill is probably his ability to “seemingly read minds”.

She loves to drink and eat Watanuki's wonderful cooking and dragging Watanuki on crazy outings at the drop of a hat.\n\nDespite this immature and free-spirited attitude, Yuuko has been known to be sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. Yuuko seems to know the true hitsuzen that Watanuki will follow, and has often offered cryptic messages to warn him of impending danger or a folk tale that he should take a bit more seriously.

She has a carefree and energetic personality, taking delight in simple matters even as she learns about all manner of things in her daily life. In Japanese, Yotsuba's dialogue is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more child-like, and in a typeface that gives the impression of speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, \"She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down.\" However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has an unexplained fear of anything resembling a bullseye.\n\nAt the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, and air conditioners all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as \"Yotsubox\" as a portmanteau of \"Yotsuba's Box\", and often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her. Yotsuba is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer.\n\nThe series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island \"to the left.\" Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims to Fuka Ayase she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old.\n\nYotsuba has never attended school, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is. In chapter 35, she fails to understand repeated explanations of homework.\n\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.

He constantly causes many problems for Kaname Chidori due to his military nature. Even in school he carries a gun with him although it is loaded with non-lethal shells. He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available \"civil\" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect. This part of his personality is indeed one of the main sources of the series' humor. \n\nHis previous name during his guerrilla days was Kashim which was given to him by Majido, a strategist of the guerrilla forces in Helmajistan. \n\nIt is assumed that he changed his name to Sagara Sousuke when he left Helmajistan.

Having a fearsome reputation for her \"God's Tongue\" to taste the food flavor accurate, Erina is able to disqualify anyone whose the dish taste \"bad\" and her foul critic could break the chef (and student alike) soul of tenacity. She is also one of the Elite 10 in Tootsuki Culinary Academy and uses her position to judge a student dish based on their family background and status.\n\nBorn in the prestige and influential family with affluent finances and refined pedigree, Erina is one of the arrogant, prideful and pampered students in Tootsuki Culinary Academy. Typical wealthy family's princess from her high famed family background, she looks down on people (particularly Souma) or society which doesn't share her lifestyle and only socialize with the group of people which have an abundance wealth and strong influences. Having a reputation known as \"God's Tongue\" for an ability to taste the food accurately and excel cooking skills, Erina is very serious upon the regal cooking style and classy ingredients, in which can't be tolerated if any failures or distaste within' the food, even the slightest could make a very big deal about it. According to the living legend, \"Doujima Gin,\" her tongue was so special that she can taste 8 different salts blindfolded. Due to her reputation, she is both inspired and feared by many newcomers within the academy (except Souma), even the academy lecturers and her \"senpai\" found her narcissistic ego was so overwhelming that she is too stubborn to listens to almost anyone. Other than that, Erina is also picky about food to which she rather picks high-class cuisine instead of daily dishes, and claimed that normal food doesn't match her taste. Erina is also sadistic to which she often relish on people suffering and reluctance over her offer as her amusement, while she is also narcissistic that only she is better than anyone in the academy (except Souma who found that she is actually dishonest to herself and even claimed her dish boring due to her ego.).\n\nDespite all of her narcissistic, arrogant and stubborn mannerism, Erina is also shown to be a \"tsundere\" student who denied almost everything even after all there are something good about it, particularly Souma which his food tasted so good that even her god tongue couldn't help but be impressed over his style. Likewise, despite her attempts to remain aloof and regal in her interactions with Souma, she is shown to be easily flustered by Souma's casual and laid back attitude due to her overrated ego and often ends up in comical embarrassment whenever Souma ignores her insults. Some situation said that Erina's imagination played an important yet ridiculous role which depends on her mood, any odd imagination she had would affect the student's result, usually the bad way. Erina also not a student who, because of her ego, admit her mistakes and her narcissistic behavior almost made her blinded and even phobia on mistakes (she may enjoy a sadistic pleasure to make her rival suffers, yet she is displeased whoever \"mock\" her or her weakness is found by certain figures). Even there is a slightest critique about her food (Souma is, in fact, the only student fearlessly point her weakness) would make her throw her tantrums, and often taking drastic measures just to cover her weakness.\n\nAlthough she rarely participate in any Shokugeki, Erina's cooking style is believed to be the finest and elegant of all. Using all of every stylish style from the wealthy and high pedigree status of culinary, she referred the lavish ingredient to make the finest dish of all and suggested that only the high grade dish considered as eatable for her standards. It is also noted by Doujima himself that her cooking skills cannot be underestimated due to her quick skills along with her nickname \"God's Tongue,\" by managing to create the dish that matched her taste before completing the dish. It is also claimed that she can cook as fast as Souma, which made her one of the proficient rivals to Souma's style even though she rarely cooks (she is prideful of her skills though)."}

Which could be how he was able to survive as a child, and up until now. And perhaps can even be described as an animal in a way. Zack is also extremely strong and rather fast, being able to run at rather incredible speed rates, and overall is actually a rather powerful character, which balances out the fact he isn't that smart. Zack is also VERY brutally honest, as he hates people who lie with a burning passion, and never ever sugarcoats anything he says.\n\nAs a child, Zack was seemingly much more quiet and reserved. He was shown to never say a word throughout the manga specifically.\n\nZack's first murder: He stayed in a run-down orphanage where children were likely to die, and the trafficking was illegal. His caretakers were rather abusive, and always referred to him as a monster, and even forced him to bury the corpse of a dead child simply because they didn't want to deal with the smell. Until one day, one of the caretakers left the TV on, where it showed a horror film that included a serial killer. And Zack just-so-happened to stumble upon it while it was on, becoming fascinated with the murderer specifically in the film. And he took inspiration from it, and he murdered his caretakers by mutilating their bodies, and later buried them in the back. And years later, his recent killings became famous, and is currently a wanted criminal.\n\n(Source: Satsuriku no Tenshi Wiki)"}

She is the first Spirit saved by Shidou and transfers into his class at the end of the first volume. Shidou named her for the date of their first meeting, the 10th. Reine later added the Yatogami surname for her. She is ignorant of the ways of the world, but nevertheless has a normal sense of embarrassment. She seems to have strong feelings for Shidou, which she is shown to be unable to understand when she gets jealous after seeing Shidou accidentally kiss Yoshino.\n\nWhen Tooka first appeared on Earth, unsealed, she was very wary of everyone before Shido finally got the chance to talk to her, because she was constantly being attacked by the AST. However after she was sealed by Shido, she could finally develop, express, and experience life on Earth. Due to the fact that Tooka is new to everything including her emotions, she has a very child-like personality that can make her seem naïve, emotional, energetic, and sometimes gullible due to the fact that she has not been on Earth that long to interact with other people.\n\nHowever, when learning that Yoshino is a Spirit like herself she decides to support Shidou in his cause to save the other Spirits such as Kurumi, even actively participating in battles at times. Due to being a Spirit, she is always being targeted by the AST and is aiming for the kill, because of that she hated humans for always shunning her and thinking that she wasn't allowed to live in this world, but her whole life changed when she met Shidou.\n\nShe was overjoyed that she could live with Shidou now but knowing that Origami was there too she was somehow agitated and is always having a minor quarrel with Origami (mostly because of Shidou and their feelings). Even with that high and cool presence, Tooka lacks some common sense and loves food very much. Despite her lack of knowledge or experience, Tooka does have a normal sense of embarrassment, as shown by her overreacting when seen naked, or caught in otherwise embarrassing situations. At times, Tooka can be surprisingly insightful, as well as perceptive and understanding in regards to other people's feelings, especially when it concerns Shido and her fellow Spirits. She gets also along very well with Kaguya and Yuzuru, especially Kaguya because of their similar energetic personalities. However, Tooka sometimes has problems understanding the two of them, because of the weird way each of them talks.\n\nTooka is a highly offensive combatant who uses a sword as her primary weapon. Aside from this, Tooka also has a lot of \"mana\" within her spirit body which increases both her offensive and defensive abilities. Her primary armament is Sandalphon, which takes on the appearance of a gilded throne which doubles as the scabbard of her broadsword. Her fighting style mostly consists of either physical attacks with \"mana\" encasement on her sword and body, or a high energy attack (like a laser beam) combined with her sword.\n\nThe throne itself seems to be a sort of support machine, based on how she uses it. It can be changed into a transport vessel by laying it horizontally, or to unlock the final form of her weapon, Halvanhelev, by cutting the throne into exact halves. Later in the series, after she got her power sealed by Shido, she can retrieve a bit of her original power if she focuses hard enough or if she becomes emotional."}

She was born between a human father and a Nekomata mother named Fujimai. Her father was a scientist who did not acknowledge Koneko or was aware that she was his child, and merely used her for experiments. Her parents eventually died in an experiment accident. However, her older sister Kuroka, omitted the truth and any other details about them from Koneko to protect her.\n\nAfter losing her parents, she and her sister were later taken in by an unnamed Devil from the branch family of the House of Naberius, who reincarnated her sister as one of the members of his peerage. However, Kuroka's power as a Nekomata supposedly soon grew out of control, eventually causing her to kill her master and become a Stray Devil on the run from her pursuers. In actuality, he had planned to experiment on Koneko in his research about creating a Super Devil, causing Kuroka to kill him in order to protect her younger sister.\n\nFollowing the incident and the failed manhunt that came after, Koneko was sentenced to death by the Devils in hopes of preventing another incident like Kuroka's from happening. However, Sirzechs Lucifer, one of the Four Great Satans, protected her and left her under his sister Rias' care. Due to the trauma, she experienced with her sister's betrayal and murder of her master, she fell into a deep depression, eventually robbing her of nearly all of her emotions until Rias helped her out of it. It was around that time Rias gave Koneko her name and made Koneko her servant. \n\nDue to witnessing her sister supposedly losing control over her nekomata power and killing her master, Koneko became traumatized by the event, causing her to become withdrawn into herself and stripping her of most of her emotions. As a result, Koneko originally had a quiet and cold personality, rarely showing any feelings or emotions, even when she was speaking. It is noted that her serious personality is a result of receiving influence from Rias and is contradictory to her sister's mischievous personality. She was also the only one in the group who did not initially get along with Issei, often insulting and rebuking the latter for his perverted nature, although she reveals that she respects him for never giving up and considers him a hard worker.\n\nShe shows the most concern for her comrades when they are in trouble, often lending her strength in fights. Koneko apparently has a problem with people calling her a midget (although the context of the phrase could be used to be called flat, as in bust size), as shown in her second battle against Freed Sellzen. This may stem from her insecurity about her own small body and bust size.\n\n\n\nPowers &amp; Abilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n\n\n(Source: High School DxD Wiki)"}

It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Minamino Shiori, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son.\n\nKurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell and he can read lips. Though Kurama is considered the second weakest of the four main fighters, topping out at low S-class power by the end of the series, he is easily the smartest fighter of the four.

{"mal_id": 945, "name": "Youichi Hiruma", "description": "Position: Quarterback \nJersey: 1 \n40 yard dash: 5.1 seconds \nBench press: 75 kg \nHeight: 176 cm \nWeight: 67 kg \nBirthday: February 7 \nHair: Blond (Originally black but he bleached it) \nEyes: Emerald Green \n\nHiruma usually acts in a vulgar, bizarre, threatening manner so as to intimidate or disturb those around him into getting what he wants. He has a cunning, goal-oriented mind and does not seem to care what means he uses to accomplish those goals. His sense of morals is lax at best, but he is quick to find the moral flaws of others, which he keeps recorded in his \"Book of Threats\" or \"Devil's Handbook,\" and uses this information to blackmail everyone from students to figures of authority into placing him in a position of power. He has little respect for authority and has in fact usurped authority over Deimon High School well before the series begins and know authority of a vice principal, using his power in the school to give himself beyond-perfect scores in all his classes and divert funds to the American football club as he desires. Besides blackmail, Hiruma can often intimidate others into taking the action he wants by waving around his vast arsenal of firearms. Even without having to take direct action, Hiruma's mere reputation is enough in some instances to make the majority of the student body fear him and bow to his authority. \n\nDespite his penchant for blackmail and breaking seemingly every school rule without consequence, Hiruma adheres to the rules of American football without exception while playing. Inagaki says that Hiruma \"does everything else to win\" and is \"only concerned with winning.\" Instead, Hiruma attempts to throw opposing teams off guard through taunts and insults. Even when Hiruma expresses excitement or happiness, he does so in a violent manner, by firing his large guns into the air or kicking a teammate in the rear when they have executed well on a play. \n\nHe addresses all members of the Deimon Devil Bats with a vulgar manner, beginning with \"Fucking\" and ending with a descriptive noun, such as \"Shorty\" for Sena or \"Monkey\" for Monta. Some characters, such as Kid, have observed that Hiruma's attitude and even aspects of his demonic appearance are an act to intimidate his opponents both on and off the field. Over time, the series has alluded to Hiruma's 'true' personality, which Sena and Mamori Anezaki have at times been shown to understand to some degree, as when one or the other correctly observes Hiruma to be worried, happy, or tired. In addition to these instances, Hiruma has shown compassion to others, though he continues to hide it with his demonic behavior —allowing Takami some privacy after a loss is one such instance. In addition, some of Hiruma's actions imply that he cares for the other members of the team more than he lets on. \n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

This is also the only kind of transportation that does not make Natsu sick. When asked why, Natsu got angry and exclaimed that Happy was a friend, not a means of transportation, ironically Natsu later gets sick when Gray gives him a piggyback ride when he's injured. He's very close to Natsu and becomes friends with Lucy quickly. The three form a team at the start of the manga. Happy is a full-fledged member of Fairy Tail, and has a member stamp on his back.

{"mal_id": 779, "name": "Lavi", "description": "Birthdate: August 10\nAge: 19\nHeight: 177 cm (5'9\"), 179 cm (5'10\")\nWeight: 62 kg (136 lbs), 68 kg (150 lbs)\nHair color: Red\nEye color: Green\nBlood type: O\nNationality: Mixed Race\nRelatives: Bookman\nLikes: Yakiniku, sleeping, annoying Kanda Yuu\nDislikes: Wasabi\nInterests: Reading\nFirst appearance in anime: Episode 12\n\nA cheerful red-haired Exorcist of mixed race, who aims to become a Bookman and is working along the Black Order just to be close to the events that must be seen. To help him, he developed an incredible memory: he is able to memorize every single aspect of something he saw, but he commented (in chapter 101) that he could identify \"the key\" (the key which Tyki Mikk gave) faster if he were to use both his eyes when sieving out the real \"key\" from the fake. He is 18 years old, and normally uses his left eye while the right eye is covered by an eye-patch. His anti-Akuma weapon is a size-shifting hammer, which he calls Oozuchi Kozuchi (大槌小槌, lit. \"big hammer small hammer\") or Nyoibo. It can grow (満, man) or extend (伸, shin). The weight increases with its size, but since Lavi is the conformer, the weight does not effect him; However, it does to everyone else. His hammer can also summon several \"judgments\" with kanji possibly representing the classical elements that can be used individually or combined. However, between some of the seals are question marks. This probably means that Lavi has some seals that he has yet to learn from his Innocence. His techniques so far, are:\n- Hi Ban: Gouka Kaijin (劫火灰燼 火判, lit. Fire Seal: Conflagration of Ash): using the fire seal to create a torrent of flames with the form of a snake;\n- Ten Ban: Raitei Kaiten (雷霆回天 天判, lit. Heaven Seal: Thundering Lightning Whirling in the Skies): using the heaven seal to liberate an immense lightning;\n- Moku Ban: Tenchi Bankai (天地盤回 木判, lit. Wood Seal: Roots Entwining Heaven and Earth): using the wood seal to control objects in nature;\n- Konbo Ban: Gouraiten (コンボ判 剛雷天, lit. Combo Seal: Strong Thunder of the Heavens): using both fire and heaven seals to create a huge snake of fire and iron. Also making a shield-like flame wall.\n\nIt was shown when Bookman told Lavi to use the wood seal to clear the clouds (Three Akuma were hiding behind the clouds). Lavi stated that he forgot he could use it to affect nature directly, and as he remembered it the question mark turned into a kanji that he used right away. If seen more carefully the kanji for the wood seal can be seen throughout the manga whenever Lavi summons his seals long before the use of the actual seal itself (e.g. during the use of the heaven seal). At the moment just before its first use the seal can be seen just behind Lavi's head and had never transformed from a question mark in the first place.\n\nThe marks of water and earth also appear among his seals. He likes to call Bookman \"Panda\" due to the thick black circles around his eyes; a converted Akuma \"Chomesuke\"; and Arystar Krory\"Kuro-chan\" in the anime and \"Kro-chan\" in the manga. He is the only character other than General Tiedoll to call Kanda by his given name (that name being Yuu, also translated as Yū or Yuu), and apparently speaks to him outside of missions, a fact that was shown when he called Allen \"beansprout\" (moyashi), saying that if Kanda could call him that, Lavi could as well, as he is the same age as Kanda. He has a habit of teasing Allen, and deems himself as his big brother. A recurring gag in the series is Lavi's fondness for beautiful older women, whenever he sees a woman his type (Example: Eliade) he'll yell out \"Strike!\" with hearts in his eye.\n\n\nThere are many different translations of his name, such as Ravi, Rabi, Labi. But it is found in the D.gray-man Omake from episode 61 that the correct spelling is Lavi.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

She is a gothic female angel, with long violet/pink hair and teal eyes. Stocking is the younger of the Anarchy sisters. Like Panty, her name derives from the object she is able to weaponize. \n\nShe is a level-headed and intelligent girl, though, she can be rude if provoked, especially towards her older sister, Panty. Stocking enjoys eating various desserts and sugary food, but doesn't seem to gain weight (she assures all the fat goes towards her breasts anyway). However, she becomes enraged and sensitive whenever someone calls her fat.\n\nStocking is often considered to be the personification of the deadly sin, Gluttony, due to her obsession with sweets. She does not share Panty's obsession with sex, even though she does display some masochistic tendencies, such as bondage, vore and electrocution, which is ironic considering she constantly insults the demon sisters and Corset affinity for similar fetishes by calling them 'BDSM loving freaks'. Stocking does claim she has very special standards in men, and prefers love over lust. She strings men along (not wanting them to believe she is 'easy'), and would never cheat on someone she truly loves. However, she has been shown to have a very strange and twisted vision of what she finds attractive. \n\nStocking hates spicy food, just as much as Panty hates sweet food. Stocking is sometimes overshadowed by Panty when in larger audiences due to the latter's more sensuous and exhibitionist behavior, such as in \"Sex and the Daten City\" and \"1 Angry Ghost.\" She is almost always seen carrying around a plush cat, Honekoneko, whose expressions often match Stocking's mood.\n\nAbilities\nTo prepare for battle, Stocking removes her stockings.

Her outfit consists of a white wide-necked sweater with blue sleeves over a black tank top, a short plaid yellow skirt which is part of the Yokai Academy's girls' uniform, pink and violet stockings (her right stocking slightly longer than her left), and a belt that is wrapped around her left thigh. \n\nMizore returns to school after a delayed absence and was first portrayed as a lonely, somewhat depressed, and misunderstood girl. She becomes infatuated with Tsukune, going so far as to create her own journal/scrapbook with all of his newspaper articles. \n\nIn the past, she confessed her love to a teacher until he began taking advantage of her, freezing him as a result. With the incident and rumors spreading about her, Mizore made it hard for herself to trust anyone, but took a liking to Tsukune, believing he was just as miserable as she was. She eventually regains her sense of trust after Tsukune intervenes when the same teacher returns to kill her. Unfortunately, this leads Mizore to stalk Tsukune on a daily basis (from around 340 spying locations, according to her). She initially sports long hair in her debut appearances, but cuts it short after the incident was cleared. Later in the second serialization, Mizore decides that even if Tsukune doesn't fall in love with her, she will follow him forever.\n\nA running gag in the series is that Mizore always appears unexpectedly in the oddest locations (under tables, behind doors, the ceiling, bushes, and even in the bathroom), and freezes any girl to disrupt any sort of tender moment Tsukune is having with the latter. \n\nKeeping in line with her kind, Mizore has the ability to control snow and ice at will, and while doing so, shapes claws of ice around her hands (her hair becomes ice on rare occasions). She can also make almost perfect copies (if a bit fragile) of herself and others with it as well, each capable of independent thought. She is also very sensitive to flames, a common weakness for ice-affiliated creatures, which was shown in one episode of the anime when she got her hand burned while preparing curry, freezing the dish on instinct as a result."}

Commonly referred as \"Yami-chan\", she spends her time reading books and magazines, while eating taiyaki (it was the only thing she ate on Earth since it was the first food offered by Rito, prior to spending a night at the Yuuki residence for a sukiyaki dinner).

He often helps Amu even though he works for Easter. Ikuto actually despises Easter and tries to wrench himself free from them by trying to find the Embryo to grant his own wish. He possesses the Dumpty Key which pairs with Amu's Humpty Lock which at first did not fit in the keyhole. Like his father, Ikuto is a skilled violinist.\n\nHis Shugo Chara is Yoru.\n\nAnon Black's Profile of Ikuto:\n\nIkuto is tall, wears dark clothing, and has dark blue hair. He's got a signature smirk that can mean both \"I'm flirting\" and \"I'm pleased with what you just said.\" His Chara-Change gives him cat ears and a tail, and causes him to behave much like a cat. His Chara-Nari is Black Lynx.\n\nIkuto plays the violin, and is the son of a famous violinist. His father married his mother, who was the heir to Easter. The company ordered that he drop everything, including his violin, for Easter. His father refused and disappeared, leaving Ikuto's mother in such distress that she was admitted to a hospital. Ikuto came to live with Tadase's family, but was treated harshly by Tadase's mother, who was jealous of her husband's relationship with Ikuto's mother. Eventually, Ikuto ran away from home, going to Tsukasa's home for an unspecified amount of time, and returning a few years before the current time to Tadase's house. There he was found by Tadase's dog, Betty, who was dead, and Tadase's grandmother, who had collapsed. Ikuto was cursed out once again, but not until he'd stolen away Tadase's Dumpty Key, which Tadase's father had given to his son when Ikuto's father left.\n\nBecause of this, Tadase and Ikuto have a very strained relationship, if any.\n\nIkuto's personality as a child was quiet, shy, and protective of his friends—when he accepts the blame for breaking the vase, even when he knew he'd be chastised for it. This part of his personality stays through his adolescence—he is more than willing to sacrifice himself for the ones he holds dear, even if it means a few nights alone on the street, being captured by Easter, or playing the villain and making himself hated.\n\nIt's obvious that Ikuto cares very much about Amu, and probably has a crush on her, especially in the way he acts with her in chapters 28-30. He seems to only show his true colors, and talk about himself, when he is in her presence. Of course, this is the way Peach-Pit has presented it to us.\n\nIkuto acts aloof, cold, flirtatious, and mysterious. He appears at will, and is openly defiant of his superiors in Easter. It's obvious he doesn't like working there, and has his own reasons for wanting the Embryo that have yet to be revealed. He takes joy in teasing and flirting with Amu, especially in her reactions.\n\nIn Shugo Chara! Doki, he stays at Easter to protect Utau. He doesn't even get near her, so that she won't have anything to do with Easter anymore."}

Her straight, well-groomed, flaxen blond hair is silky smooth and lustrous. Her large caramel-colored eyes are framed by long lashes on both the top and bottom. Additionally, she has pale, milky-white skin that is soft and flawless, and a shapely nose.\n\nHer clothing choices are trendy yet high-quality and practical. They are modest and not too revealing, reflecting her humble and unassuming personality.\n\nDue to her parents' abandonment, both physically and emotionally, Mahiru was raised by Koyuki-san, a housekeeper. This has made her very withdrawn, much like a lone flower in an unreachable place. She hides her thoughts and feelings behind a figurative mask, appearing angelic but distant. Mahiru excels in cooking, impressing Amane, his friends, and his parents. She is also very organized, practical, and frugal, easily managing household tasks. \n\nMahiru excels both academically and athletically, often ranking at the top of her class with perfect scores.

She goes out of her way to help others when she feels safe doing so.

Her private honesty emerges more clearly when she is alone, though she never expresses it harshly.\n\nMahiru has some social awkwardness, particularly in close relationships, often making gestures that might be misinterpreted. She also struggles with self-confidence and is often surprised by, and relieved from, genuine compliments from Amane.\n\nMahiru, being the most popular girl at school, primarily interacts with other female students due to the frequent and unwanted attention from boys who are infatuated with her. She dislikes this attention and is cautious about trusting strangers. To keep people at a distance and protect her privacy, she readily lies or obfuscates the details of her life. Despite these efforts, she maintains an impeccable image, always appearing polite and humble about her achievements, which further reinforces her perfect reputation among her peers.\n\n(Source: Otonari no Tenshi-sama Wiki)"}

Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\n\nAs a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji possesses Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.\n\nBecause his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \n\nAfter the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan."}

{"mal_id": 632, "name": "Mamimi Samejima", "description": "Mamimi Samejima, 17, was Tasuku's girlfriend, though she hits on Naota since his brother left Japan. She is a truant high school student with pyromaniacal tendencies; she also smokes a lot and spends most of her time under a bridge. She is often seen with a camera, and was once seen smoking worn cigarette with \"Never Knows Best\" written onto the paper.\n\nShe has the peculiar tendency to name people and things \"Ta-kun (Or sometimes simply spelled as Takkun),\" after her personal nickname for Naota's brother (and Naota himself). The \"-kun\" suffix is an informal and intimate honorific primarily used when addressing males of equal or junior status. Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as \"Ta-kun\" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. (Naota is well-aware of the similarity between his nickname and his brother's name.) Mamimi also calls Tasuku \"Tasuku-sempai\" since he is an older classmate.\n\nThe story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota's classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain and her peers to bully her. In fact, Mamimi can be exceedingly destructive—although only when nobody is watching. She spends much of FLCLimax exacting retribution against those who have wronged her—only to have her plan backfire.\n\nMamimi can be seen to lack control over her life or willpower, hence the near-constant smoking and child-like reliance on others, whether it'd be Naota or his older brother Tasuku. This could also explain why she loves taking care of things that are weak-willed, which she leaves (or which escape, like Ta-kun, the black kitten) when they start to show independence. This leads to her eventual disinterest in Naota and ultimately proves a disaster for her when her last adoptee, the terminal core from a robot, goes haywire and overpowers first her and then the military.\n\nAs far as high schoolers go, she seems to be rather sexually frustrated, as she often pursues an uncomfortable level of intimacy with Naota (most likely because she sees him as his brother's replacement), which annoys Naota greatly. When he asks why she constantly clings to him, she responds \"If I don't, I'll overflow.\"\n\nMost characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota's friends refer to her as \"Naota's Wife\" and Haruko calls her \"Sameji,\" a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as \"that high school girl.\""}

{"mal_id": 8446, "name": "Franken Stein", "description": "Dr. Franken Stein (Franken being his first name) is the man that changed Sid into a zombie. He was also Death Scythe’s first partner (Maka's mother was the second). He was also the most powerful technician to ever graduate from the school, Shibusen. He has a bolt going through his head which turns so his thoughts would be on the matter at hand. He mostly moves by pushing his chair in the direction he wants to go even if it ends up with him crashed on the floor. Stein is such a strong fighter that he could take down Black Star while still seated in his chair. Stein sees everything in the world, including himself, as an experiment or specimen. He even experimented on Spirit (now Death Scythe) when he was sleeping during the five years they worked together. His understanding of soul wavelengths gives him a huge advantage against other users since he can change his own to match the other’s wavelength and thereby nullify or disrupt the soul frequency of the technician and weapon. This comes from his high spiritual flexibility and by observing his opponent beforehand. His soul wavelength is so high that he doesn’t need a weapon and can channel it through his body and release it out of his body as electric discharge. He has a strange hobby of wanting to dissect anything he thinks is interesting. He is also the school doctor; he still respects Spirit and still calls him Senpai.\n\nOther than his electric charges, he uses a repertoire of other techniques such as Soul Sutures, a technique which binds people to e.g. the ground via a soul wavelength (the technique is costly, it requires so much attention the wielder cannot move), Witch Hunter (the technique Maka uses) when he is using Spirit as a weapon, and the ability to cancel out direct soul attacks by matching wavelengths (explained earlier)."}

He wears a straw hat and a pink flowered haori over his captain's uniform. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pinwheel hairpin is very expensive. In his off time, he can be seen drinking sake and napping. Other times, he likes to chase after women, which is noted by Yasochika Iemura of the 4th Squad when commenting in his diary. In particular, he often flirts with his lieutenant, Nanao Ise, whom he calls 'my Nanao-chan' (little Nanao). In one of the omake outtakes he told Rangiku Matsumoto to buy Nanao Ise a sexy outfit while in the human world. Matsumoto brings back a skimpy two piece bathing suit which Nanao refuses to try on. He is close friends with 13th Division Captain Jushiro Ukitake, with whom he graduated from the shinigami academy and works with often.\n\nKyouraku tends to use a more familiar speech style than most other characters in Bleach. He generally refers to his fellow captains and shinigami by their first name followed by an honorific, and is the only character who dispenses with honorifics when addressing General Yamamoto, calling him old Yama (Yama-jī). Even Ukitake, who was also taught by Yamamoto, does not do this.\n\nKyouraku is a peace-loving man who will always try to talk his way out of a fight. However, he does not wish to insult his opponents by not fighting, either, as he explains to Chad. Since he has achieved the rank of captain, it is implied that he must be a powerful fighter, but the true extent of his abilities has not been seen in the series. General Yamamoto states that Kyouraku and Jushiro Ukitake, both of whom he trained himself, possess \"greater powers on the battlefield than any younger generation, or old,\" suggesting that the two are more powerful than any other captains, with the possible exception of Yamamoto himself.\n\nThe slightly eccentric Kyouraku also seems to like making an impression on opponents. In the Soul Society arc, when Kyouraku confronts Chad who had invaded the 8th division area, he has Nanao Ise scatter rose petals over him to make a dramatic entrance. It creates this effect at first, but when Nanao doesn't stop dropping the petals and Kyouraku begins to exhort her to stop in an embarrassing manner, she dumps the whole basket on him, burying him and ruining his entrance.\n\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Bleach Official Character Book Souls page 136)"}

She is mature for her age with a cold, tsundere-like personality. She has a strong \"little sister\" fetish and owns many adult games with older brother/little sister themes, relying on a modeling job to pay for them. Despite this, she states she does not know why she started liking it, though it is suggested that she has a brother complex and is using the games as a surrogate to this. She often denies such feelings and believes the 2D and 3D worlds should be kept separate.\n\nAs a student, Kirino possesses a keen focus to studying and athletics. This attitude of hers when it comes to school activities has rewarded her with above-average marks, even as she enters the career of modeling. She developed a sort of perfectionist attitude due to becoming an overachiever, which eventually made her more prone to struggling when the odds are against her. When these moments come, however, she displays a more passive side.\n\nUpon her initial interactions with Kyousuke, she demonstrates an attitude similar to a \"tsundere,\" with the bossy and abusive part more dominant.

Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori's death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.\n\nIn battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack.

She is a girl whose heart beats slower than the average person and she seeks a lover that will help her cope with her condition.\n\nRuka's most identifying features are her short black hair and blue eyes tied up with a ribbon, usually a blue one. With her ribbon off, her hair is a voluminous layered bob. She's often in her school uniform, which consists of a white button up with a tie, a blue blazer and a hiked up skirt. During her rental dates, she usually wears a turtleneck sweater with a variety of patterned short skirts. Her casual wear usually consists of sundresses, though she wears longer sleeved clothing and leggings when dressed up for conservative occasions.\n\nRuka has a womanly figure that belies her youthful appearance. Although she personally admits her figure isn't as filled out as Chizuru's, she is described as having a sizable bosom and long, slender legs. She is considered very attractive, often comparatively with Chizuru by the male characters, and tends to gather a lot of attention when in public.\n\nRuka is described to be a cheerful, determined, and passionate girl. She is a straightforward person who is honest with her feelings. On the flip side, her traits often convey her as being self-centered, pushy and possessive. This personality of hers developed after learning of her condition and being alienated from her peers. Because of this, she became very fixated on the idea that getting a boyfriend would help her in having a faster heartbeat.\n\nRuka's brash persona often leads to conflicts with Kazuya and, more specifically, Chizuru. On top of that, her determination can lead her to being stubborn to a fault. This often leads to her making poor decisions to get what she wants, and she will often throw tantrums or act out if things don't go her way.\n\nRuka is born with an irregular heartbeat, leading her life to be tormented for being treated differently from the others because she can collapse if she performs a hard working activity. This leads her to become a rental girlfriend as a wish to have someone who can make her heart beat faster without any trouble. For a while, all the people she met with had no effect on her, until she met one who was truly genuine during a coincidental meetup, Kazuya Kinoshita.\n\nThe sincerity of Kazuya made her fall in love with him and slowly led to her decision to quit her rental girlfriend job. She technically blackmails Kazuya into being her \"trial boyfriend\" under the condition that she does not reveal Chizuru's job and her relationship with Kazuya. Unfortunately, this causes her to become a thorn on Kazuya's side. To make the matter worse for Kazuya, she now works at the same job as him.\n\n(Source: Kanojo, Okarishimasu Wiki)"}

Version 2 houses a giant machine gun (long part of the cross) and finally, a rocket launcher in the top, while the ammunition is stored in the arms of the cross(an alternate opinion is simply that one of the horizontal arms holds ammo for the machine gun and rocket launcher while the other holds six pistols). The trigger for the Version 2 is a skull shaped symbol in the centre of the cross. As can be expected, the weapon/case is very heavy, and only Wolfwood, Milly, and Vash seem to have no trouble holding it (though Vash once comments on its weight). The weapon is not actually named in the anime, but it is commonly referred to as Punisher, which comes from the manga. Wolfwood states that it's heavy \"with God's mercy,\" a fitting statement from the cynical Wolfwood.\n\nHe is modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto, the lead singer of the Japanese rock band Ulfuls. The name Wolfwood (ウルフウッド urufuddo) is a corruption of Ulfuls (ウルフルズ urufuruzu), which is in turn a corruption of the English word soulful (ソウルフル sōrufuru).\n\nNightow is frequently asked in interviews and at convention panels what the \"D.\" in Wolfwood's name stands for. His responses have varied each time, ranging from \"Dangerous\" to \"Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora.\" The latter is actually stereotypical yakuza slang, and would be written out as \"どこの組の者じゃ、われ！？　簀巻きにして沈めたろか、こら！\", which roughly means \"What the hell family do you think you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!\". The common theme in these various expansions of the single letter \"D\" is one of destructive force, anger, or violence, which are traits Nightow has modeled the character after.\n\nIn the original Japanese version, Wolfwood speaks in a Kansai Dialect. Nightow has said of this: \"It's an English-speaking world, so he's not actually speaking Kansai dialect. Think of it as indicating some accent.\"\n\n\n(Source: Answers.com, Wikipedia, Nicholas D.

He seems to have a love of collecting rare treasures, having a large collection of antiques and priceless artifacts and weapons, some of which are thousands of years old. Ironically, he treats them rather poorly. He does not care when they are destroyed and has been shown to abuse or misuse them himself on occasion. He is confident in his abilities, though rightfully so as he is one of the most powerful beings. Despite this, he does have a more vulnerable side. \n\n\n(Source: Heaven Official's Blessing Wiki)"}

He was supposed to serialize a manga titled Yellow Hit but he wanted to draw a different manga, Crow, which appeared in Akamaru Jump instead. His assistants were initially Nakai and Fukuda (Mashiro also worked for him temporarily before Detective Trap was serialized). His editor is Hattori Yujiro. He once demanded to be allowed to end one series he hated if he ever made it as the most popular author in Jump.\n\nNiizuma is slightly naive but can also be serious and calculating when he wants to. Eiji tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he grew more humble, even claiming to not be \"good enough of a mangaka to be judging other people's work\" when asked by his editor to judge for the Golden Future Cup. (He judges anyway but is not very helpful, only expressing his interest in Ashirogi and Ryu Shizuka). \n\nNiizuma tends to make noises and sound effects when drawing or writing his manga. He is constantly chastised by his editor, and at first seems to be rather oblivious toward his rivals' feelings toward him, even expressing great excitement when he meets Ashirogi Muto and saying he is their fan. He is a great lover of manga and his opinion are valued by everyone at Jump, including his rivals. He refers to himself as an \"Eternal Boy,\" and that is why he writes shounen manga."}

After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was.\n\nHe now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the \"rotten\" post-Joui war world.\n\nHe is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks.\n\nIt can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war.

{"mal_id": 1375, "name": "Dark Yuugi", "description": "Age: 3000+\nBlood type: A \nHeight: 153 cm \nWeight: 42 kg\n\nYami Yuugi is the spirit of the ancient Pharaoh residing in the Millennium Puzzle. His past is shrouded in mystery. 3,000 (5,000 in the dub) years later, Yuugi Mutou, after trying to solve the puzzle for eight years, awakens the Pharaoh from his slumber, although Yuugi does not realize this until much later in the story. At the end of Duelist Kingdom, the Pharaoh asks Yuugi to help him recover his memories and Yuugi agrees to help him.  \n\nIn the early manga, Dark Yugi starts out as an merciless vigilante. He emerges to deal justice to people who trespass the souls of Yugi and his friends. Although his acts are righteous, he lives up to his namesake of Dark; his Penalty Game punishments are usually very brutal. Later, while living inside Yugi's body, he seems to become more of a caring, nice and friendly disposition, even though he always had that in him, and the friendship of Yugi's friends had helped it be revealed to others. Yami is a strong, powerful and skilled Pharaoh. He attempts to balance darkness and evil in his use of the Shadow Magic from his Millennium Item. Unlike Yami Bakura and Yami Marik, he never uses it for personal gain, instead preferring to help others in need, and to inflict punishment only on people who have severely wronged innocents. He is slightly reserved, as he doesn't reveal his existence to Yugi or his friends. At first Yugi feared Yami Yugi, but after Yugi admits to thinking \"another Yugi\" exists inside him, his friends become aware of his existence and accepted him as a friend. Even before, Yami is extremely protective of Yugi. \n\nYami's pride is his greatest strength and weakness. Initially he refuses to lose games, because it would cause him to lose the chance to save Grandpa. This has caused him to almost kill Seto Kaiba by attacking his monster while he stood on a ledge and the shockwaves could cause him to fall if Yugi chose to win the Duel (in the Japanese version, Kaiba threatened to commit suicide should he lose).  Learning how to lose became an essential aspect of Yami's journey, which he is tested in the Battle Ritual. Yami is also wise and intelligent. He knows all the rules and details of how the game is played, as well as those of all games. He also knows several special game techniques, such as the Double Hit dice roll technique, which, when two dice are used and the one with the weak spin stops first, lets him make the dice that's already spinning hit the one that isn't, allowing him to change its number, which is done by bumping the field with a body part, e.g the elbow. Despite being an ancient Pharaoh, Yami is very quick to learning and utilizing modern technology. He, despite initial shock, was able to quickly grasp the concept of holographic technology, how Dueling Arenas and field Power Bonuses worked, was able to use the Dungeon Dice Monsters Help computer to quickly formulate strategies, and was able to use Duel Disks flawlessly on the first try. Yami is also capable of translating the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, figuring out the riddles or clues and what they mean. Through Yugi and his friends, Yami Yugi learns the values and powers of friendship and unity. After seeing Yugi overcome Marik in his Duel with Jonouchi, who has been possessed, Yami thinks to himself, he learned something from Yugi; that in kindness lies the greatest strength of all; one day Yugi will surpass him. Also, Yami has been protecting Yugi, and Yugi has learned from him the spirit of \"never shrink back no matter how difficult it is\". At the end of the story, Yugi grows enough to be self-reliant, and Yami's soul gets freedom.\n\nBattle City\n\nDoma Arc\n\nMemory World\n\n\n(Source: Yugipedia)"}

She does not remove her hairpins, except to sleep (she is seen without them in episode 64 when she wakes up), as they are worn in memory of her brother, while her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Her large breasts are occasionally made the subject of jokes in the series. She also has an amazingly hard head, which has injured Uryū, Chad, and Ichigo. The only person who has been able to damage her head has been Yachiru Kusajishi in a comical moment when she is riding on Kenpachi Zaraki's shoulders. Orihime has yellow-orange/brown eyes in colored pictures of the manga, but gray eyes in the anime.\n\nOrihime is friendly, humorous in her own way, sensitive, and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Apparently, she is hopeless when it comes to technology. One of the members of the Handicrafts' Club remarks that she is not smart enough to use a cell phone, which is why she does not have one. Additionally, according to Tatsuki, Orihime has the fighting skill of a black belt, however, in the English dubbed version she says Orihime is at the skill of a yellow belt.\n\nOrihime cooks and eats strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Aside from Rangiku Matsumoto and possibly Tessai Tsukabishi, no one shares Orihime's tastes. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes.\n\nOrihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences. At one point, the schoolgirls ask Rukia if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls \"team\" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking \"How do you see yourself in the future?\" when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have.\n\nOrihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored.\n\nOrihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, Sora, who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive.\n\nWhen Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met Tatsuki who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since."}

He was first introduced as a prodigious, cold-hearted gamer who stopped at nothing to achieve his goals, even resorting to seemingly killing his opponents. He is also Mokuba's older brother and the current majority shareholder and CEO of his own multi-national gaming company, KaibaCorp, and aims to become the world's greatest player of Duel Monsters. Following his second Duel with Yugi, he was left in a coma where he reassembled the shattered puzzle of his heart and emerged less evil. Though reformed, Kaiba retains his arrogance and rivalry with Yugi, but regains compassion for his younger brother, Mokuba.  \n\nHe can be condescending, selfish, no-nonsense, and narcissistic, but, as Dark Yugi has said he can be oblivious at times. However, it is stated by Mokuba that ever since being adopted by Gozaburo, Kaiba became much colder than he used to be. Despite this, Kaiba still has strong brotherly instincts for Mokuba and will put his life in danger in a heart beat to safeguard Mokuba's life. Apart from Mokuba, Kaiba has compassion for children—especially orphans (as he himself was one and knew what it felt like). Kaiba is willing to put his life or other lives on the line to achieve his goals or settle a conflict. He showed almost no fear when Dark Yugi warned him about the possibility of a fatal outcome of a Shadow Game and tries to kill Yugi and his friends during Death-T. However, when he learned that death was the price to be paid in Yugi's Duel with the brainwashed Jonouchi, Kaiba was sickened by the prospect, claiming that even at his worst he would not have done this and attempted to stop the Duel. Like the Pharaoh, pride is Kaiba's strength and weakness; he never backs down from a fight and gives everything he can in a Duel. This results in his sense of superiority and sense of arrogance, making it extremely difficult to earn his respect, and causes him to look down on and treat others as inferior until they do so. This gives him difficulty when forced to rely on others and work as a team. His pride in himself and his accomplishments are prominent parts of his character throughout the series, and he reacts harshly to those who threaten or infringe on it. \n\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Yugipedia)"}

{"mal_id": 1044, "name": " Lupin III", "description": "Age: Late 20s - early 30s \nBirthday: 10 February (The Castle of Cagliostro) \nHeight: 179 cm \nWeight: 63 kg\n\nLupin III is the grandson of Arsène Lupin. He is the world's most wanted thief. Often in his adventures, he takes it upon himself and his gang to foil other criminals engaged in more serious crimes. He sometimes appears incompetent, but mostly as a charade to catch his opponents off guard. While he has been arrested and thrown in jail on several occasions, he has always managed to break out. His infatuation with Fujiko Mine is perhaps his biggest weakness, as it often lands him in undesirable situations. \n\nIn Monkey Punch's original manga, Lupin is cocky, quite crude, and for the most part remorseless. He is very much the ladies' man, often using them for his own gains, and is not beyond forcing himself upon women who resist him. This is in stark contrast to his better-known anime self, who although a skilled thief, occasionally comes off as a chivalrous goofball who enjoys helping those less fortunate than he. Furthermore, Lupin often takes it upon himself and his gang to stop criminals engaged in more violent crimes and leave them for Zenigata to arrest. In the anime, while he fancies himself a Casanova, his actual success with women is erratic, appearing to fluctuate with the writer.\n\nEven though his gang's loyalty has been an issue, with Fujiko willing to betray and cohort Goemon promising to eventually kill him, Lupin will still drop everything to come to their aid in a helpless moment; further the team would rather face torture than to betray Lupin (or he betray them) to a third party. This rule of loyalty curiously extends as well to Inspector Zenigata, whom Lupin considers a respected friend and opposition. The Inspector reciprocates this regard and out of gratitude has vowed never to attempt to kill Lupin. Lupin's vendetta against the Tarantula Gang in In Memory of the Walther P-38 was partly settling of past betrayal and mostly vengeful payback for their shooting and nearly killing Zenigata.\n\nIt seems Lupin loves to steal more than actually having the treasure he sought. Lupin relishes more in the challenge of stealing and, as long as he succeeds in the heist, is usually not that upset when he ends up empty-handed; there have been times he has lost the object or intentionally thrown it away. There have also been times when Lupin stole an object only to give it to someone else, such as if it rightfully belonged to them or they needed it more than he did.\n\nWhen not involved in criminal activities, Lupin usually spends his time dating beautiful girls, fishing, race car driving, attending formal dinners, playing pool, casino gambling, and participating in café society. His favorite foods seem to be mostly French cuisine, sushi, and seafood; when on a job he may settle with ramen noodles. In Lupin the Third Part V, he is shown with an affection for galettes. He also smokes cigarettes and occasionally cigars and kreteks; in the manga, he's seen smoking a briar pipe. His preferred cigarette is the famous French brand Gitanes. Lupin is a celebrated race car driver, competing in several international events when time allows. He's also a skilled sleight of hand artist who loves to befuddle his opponents with various gimmicks: i.e., a cigarette which explodes into confetti, a gun with a spring-loaded boxing glove that clobbers the shooter, and bubble gum that becomes plastique after brief chewing. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Lupin III Wiki)"}

He has seven scars on his chest in the shape of the \"Hokuto Shichisei,\" or Big Dipper, that were put there by Shin\n\nA strong and mostly stoic character, Kenshirou is compelled to punish evil-doers and can perform feats not possible for most people. His mastery of the ancient martial art Hokuto Shinken allows him to kill or cripple with a mere touch. The results tend to be very messy -it usually causes parts of the victim to explode- but the art also includes several other means of killing. He can also use this art to heal or to alter people's behavior. Later in the series Kenshirou learns parts of other martial arts.\n\nWhen angry his spiritual powers reach their peak, normally culminating in the dramatic destruction of his shirt and jacket (which, despite the obvious lack of a wardrobe or clothing store, are always replaced in the next episode or story arc) to expose his muscular torso.\n\nHis catchphrase is Omae wa mō shindeiru (おまえはもう死んでいる), meaning \"You are already dead,\" which he usually says before a villain's head is about to explode.\n\nAfter surviving the nuclear war, he tries to live in peace with his fiancee Yuria, until Jagi instigates Shin, a jealous rival from the Nanto Seiken school, to challenge, then defeat Kenshirou. Shin then engraves the iconic seven scars on Kenshirou's chest and leaves him for dead. Prior to this event he was more forgiving of his enemies, as shown in a flashback of Jagi's failed assassination attempt against him, in which Kenshirou chooses to spare Jagi's life after defeating him rather than end it. When Kenshirou later fights his old rivals in the present, particularly Shin, Jagi, and Raoh, they all remark on Kenshirou's acquired mercilessness.\n\nThe initial story arc centers around Kenshirou's quest to reclaim Yuria from Shin. In the very first chapter, he meets a pair of orphans who follows him in his journey: Bat, a thief; and Lin, a young girl rescued by Ken. Through the course of the series, Kenshirou protects the weak and innocent from the numerous gangs roaming the post-apocalyptic wasteland, eventually gaining his reputation as the \"Savior of the Century's End.\" Kenshirou's skills improve through his encounters with members of the Nanto Roku Seiken and his Hokuto Brothers.\n\nAlthough still emotionally repressed and stoic like most male heroes in 1980's media, Kenshirou is notable in anime culture for being a sensitive and kind-hearted man who broke the then-ironclad \"men don't cry\" cultural expectation. He is famous for openly shedding tears, if not outright weeping for the suffering of innocents and the deaths of his few noble enemies. This trait is unfortunately downplayed in the 1980's anime adaptations, but comes back into the franchise in the adaptations of the 1990s and onward."}

She eventually started to interact with people who saw her video feed (while still disguised).

She has physical abilities far beyond that of a human and also has a distinctive tail coming from her back (which is very sensitive).\n\nBeing an alien, Lala has far more strength, power and speed than the average human. Her physical strength (without any inventions or powers) surpasses any human on Earth, and maybe even some aliens in the solar system. She has also shown slight durability even with her own tongue, like when she ate one of Run's really spicy sandwiches and it didn't even phase her.\n\nShe can fire laser beams from her tail. However, her tail is both her weapon and her weakness. On Planet Deviluke, females' tails are far more sensitive than males'. When someone touches Lala's tail, she becomes weak and seems to lose her strength, though she can shake anyone off of her tail with her astonishing strength.\n\nPerhaps Lala's most distinguishing ability is being an extraordinary inventor. She is considered a genius and has made many inventions; however, Lala very much has the personality of both a perky child and an absent-minded scientist, resulting in all of her inventions being very toy-like, troublesome, and serving no important purpose besides fun, mischief, and unintentional fanservice. A running gag in the plot is that her inventions usually do not work as well as Lala and the others had hoped, often resulting into a perverted accident.\n\n(Source: To LOVE-Ru Wikia)"}

The nation was very prosperous: vast resources, beautiful arts, beautiful women, and happy citizens. The prince wanted for nothing, and was beloved throughout the kingdom. While he was a bit strange, not caring for politics or money, he was strong in his belief that he would be able to help the common people. He studied cultivation from a young age at the renowned Taoist Huang Ji Temple. It was there that he met one of his future generals, Mu Qing. Mu Qing worked as an errand boy at the temple, and only with Xie Lian's recommendation was he given the chance to study cultivation. As a child of Xianle royalty, he was known to be pampered and spoiled since young. He was kind, beloved and determined to help the common people no matter how it would affect his own status. \n\n \nBy the time of his third ascension, Xie Lian is a kind and gentle person. Although he acknowledges his abilities, he remains down-to-earth. He never holds his status above others and treats people equally, disregarding status as a sign of one's worth. He is a compassionate man who's willing to offer his help, being indifferent towards opinions of others. Although he does not care for reputation, he still finds himself often caught in situations that make him unsure whether to laugh or cry, usually when faced with moments that cause him embarrassment or feeling awkward. While he does not forget past grievances, most are usually pushed to the back of his mind, and he doesn't hesitate to save those he's had conflicts with. Similarly, he is loyal to those who are kind to him and those he considers friends. Despite having seen the worst that both humanity and the gods have done, he can also see the best in others. He sometimes has wrong perceptions of people's personalities, but he's usually convinced of their good sides and believes the people he knows even when circumstances may say otherwise. In the direst of situations, he is still able to remain calm and think up strategies on how to defeat the enemy. However, when faced with Hua Cheng's flirtatious and romantic gestures, he becomes quite flustered. While strategically intelligent and able to see past people's lies and deceptions due to his many years of suffering and witnessing political struggles, he seems partially oblivious to romantic advances. \n\n(Source: Heaven Official's Blessing Wiki)"}

Ever since her cousin Erina told Alice her cooking was terrible when they were children, Alice's goal has been to become a top class chef and surpass Erina and her God Tongue.  Before moving back to Japan to attend Tootsuki, she lived in Denmark with her family and began her focus on molecular gastronomy.  As a result, her cooking is based on combining modern tools with the most advanced theories in order to deliver the best dishes she possibly can.\n\nAlice has short silver hair with a left bang that is longer than the rest of her hair.  She has fair skin and red eyes and tends to wear the beige Tootsuki vest uniform instead of the standard school uniform, and her cooking uniform is a short-sleeved chef's uniform with red accents on her cuffs and collar.\n\nAlice has a very demanding personality that seems to emphasize her Nakiri upbringing.  She's bossy and pushy, and will do what it takes to get her way, utilizing not only her personality but also her incredibly advanced cunning and wit. As a result, she absolutely hates to lose; an example here is the fact that—not wanting to be outdone by Erina— once she saw that Erina had an aid called Hisako Arato, she in turn forcefully made Kurokiba Ryo join her as an aid. When not competing, though, Alice is extremely friendly and talkative. She loves to prod and make fun of people during conversations, but will pout to no end when she wants or needs something or thinks something has happened to make her look worse."}

He has a soft spot for kittens (including his own, Eikichi) and an iron code of honor. He develops a minor crush on Botan when he first meets her, but later harbors intense feelings on the ice apparition Yukina, but is unaware that she is Hiei's sister.\n\nKuwabara has a tough older sister named Shizuru Kuwabara. She and Yukina are the only characters known to call him by his given name. In the anime, Kazuma and Shizuru's parents never appear and are rarely, if ever, even acknowledged. His father does makes a brief appearance in the final volume of the manga to reveal that Yukina is going to be living with them and appears to be aware of the Reikai, etc. As the show progress, Kuwabara's and Yusuke's relationship evolves from rivals to best friends, although the two still disagree constantly.

She is an adolescent but very powerful sorceress, with a great love of money, treasure (especially the magical sort) and food. In the anime and manga (but not the light novel) Lina uses overly destructive magic recklessly (but comically), often with little provocation. She is reputed to be an evil, powerful, destructive, diminutive sorceress (the evil part isn't true). She has an older sister, Luna, who is a powerful swordswoman. Although Lina has faced down dragons, monsters, and even Dark Lords with little fear, the mere mention of Luna's name sends her into terrified hysterics. She also suffers from a fear of slugs.\n\nIn the first episode of the TV series, she introduces herself by destroying a gang of bandits known as the Dragon Fangs. She steals a large portion of their treasure, then sets off towards the nearest town to cash it in for a sizable profit. On the way to the town she is ambushed by the remainder of the Dragon Fangs. However, mere seconds before she would have blasted them to bits, Gourry Gabriev valiantly comes to her \"rescue\" and they begin their adventures together. In manga, anime and novels, Lina and Gourry do fall in love, but acting on these feelings is an entirely different story.\n\nLina has many different nicknames, one of them being \"Dragon Spooker,\" a name that she isn't too fond of. This is rumored to have appeared because of an incident in the first episode, in which the Leader of the Dragon Fangs’ pet black dragon escapes. Just when it appears that the beast is going to crush Lina (and Gourry, who was knocked out on top of her in a compromising position), it blanches in disgust and steps over her, a blush along its snout, much to her shock, and thereafter rage. However, the nickname was mentioned before the black dragon met her, thus leading to a possible earlier incident.\n\nAnother nickname Lina encounters is the \"Dragon Nester.\" This comes from a rhyme: \"Little girl with little breasts, scares the dragon from its nest.\" This takes off from a running gag, in which characters constantly comment on the small size of Lina's breasts. She generally takes offense to these comments, and often responds with violence. This nickname only appears in the English dub but small breast jokes are a staple of the franchise.\n\nIn Slayers TRY, Gourry, Amelia and Zelgadis find out that Lina has an elder sister named Luna. Luna is a skilled and powerful warrior, who later retired and became a waitress in Lina's hometown. When Lina refused to accompany Filia on her quest, Filia handed Lina a letter from Luna that said, \"Shut up and do it!\" prompting Lina to cower in fear."}

Initially, he is sent to the world with a flute that contains the Djinn, Ugo, and a magic turban. He meets Alibaba in Qishan and gets convinced to go dungeon diving with him to capture Amon, after Alibaba witnesses the powers that Aladdin contains within his flute.\n\n\n\nAs a Magi, Aladdin is very powerful. He can use Magoi and several types of Magic to fight in a battle and can easily overpower strong fighters like Morgiana. It is revealed that he has always known the magic Ugo once used on his hands called Har-Har Infigar. Ugo taught him it just in case, so whenever Ugo used this magic, it was actually Aladdin that supplied the Magoi. He was told in Magnostadt that he is classified as a \"Red Magician,\" one who specializes in flame and heat magic.\n\n\n\nAladdin has a kind and cheerful personality, and as such he is easily able to make friends. He cherishes friends a lot since he's never really had friends except for Ugo prior to his arrival in the world, and gets upset if people disrespects them or harms them, even holding grudges against those who hurt them. In order to help his friends, he's become dedicated to becoming stronger. Aladdin does everything he can to defend and protect his friends from enemy attack, even to the point of him almost dying due to over-exertion.\n\nHe's a little naive about the world, not knowing what bazaars or Dungeons are because most of his life was spent in the Room of Fortitude. However, he is rather wise for his age, able to offer advice to others and providing remarkable insight at various points of time. Aladdin never seems condescending when criticizing others, and offers his opinions and thoughts in a matter-of-fact manner. He also has a calm temperament, even able to stay level-headed in dangerous or dire situations to think up of plans and solutions. He's also very eager to learn, demonstrating great enthusiasm in learning magic from Yamraiha and in his classes in Magnostadt.\n\nAladdin isn't shown to be a greedy person as demonstrated when he doesn't use his one wish for fortune or eternal life from Ugo and readily offering his whole bag of coins to hitch a ride to Magnostadt. Despite all this, however, he is quite perverted for his age as he likes to grope women with \"large, soft breasts\" and according to Alibaba, has \"manly interests.\"\n\nAladdin also has a tendency to eat food that isn't his, such as when he ate all the watermelons in a cart belonging to Alibaba's master as shown in the anime, and Leila's precious watermelons in the manga. He also harbors a secret feeling of loneliness because he's different from everyone else since he's a magician and since he's different even from the three other Magis, him being the fourth Magi that shouldn't even exist.\n\n(Source: Magi Character Encyclopedia, Magi Official Guidebook, Magi Wikia)"}

She was an original design of Hatsune Miku, created by huke who participated in the release of the song \"Black★Rock Shooter\" by supercell.\n\n\nCharacter Design:\nBlack★Rock Shooter's original design is of a pale-skinned, blue-eyed girl, with black hair in uneven twintails; the right lock of her hair is shorter than her left. She bears two scars on her midriff. A blue flame shoots out from her left eye.\n\nHer clothes consist of a string bikini top under a black jacket. The jacket has a white stripe running along the length of each of her sleeves and has a white star design on the front (left side) and back. She also wears a pair of tight-fitting shorts, gloves, and black knee-high boots.\n\nHer weapons consist of a black-hilted katana later named as Black Blade and a large gun called ★rock Cannon. She is the \"other self\" of Mato in the other world.\n\nOVA:\nA shot of Black★Rock Shooter from the OVA, showing her signature blue flame. The OVA adaptation added some details to Black★Rock Shooter. Unlike in her original design, her eyes have a concentric circle pattern, a trait she shares with other characters in the OVA.\nBlack★Rock Shooter is also given a personality in the OVA. She is depicted as a calm and collected girl, not speaking at all until her confrontation with Mato, near the end of the OVA. She also does not focus on anything except the most important thing she has to do at the moment.\n\nShe is shown to be very skilled in fighting, despite being quickly taken down by Black★Gold Saw in her first shown battle. Black★Rock Shooter is able to fight evenly with Dead Master, despite appearing to try not to hurt her.\n\n\nAnime Adaptation:\nBlack★Rock Shooter has been redesigned for the anime, with some new elements possibly inspired by the designs of White Rock Shooter and Black★Rock Shooter Beast, as her new jacket and boots (which are now more blue than black) have similarities to both WRS' and B★RSB's clothing. Like her hairstyle in the PSP game, her hairstyle is spikier compared to her OVA appearance. She no longer has any scar on her midriff. She wears her trademark hood more often than she does in other media. Black★Rock Shooter in the anime seems to be more brutal than any other B★RS incarnation, having beheaded Chariot and Arata's possible other self, and killed Dead Master.\n\n(Source: Black★Rock Shooter Wikia)"}

He is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics. His appearance is more humanoid than most other Beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. He is skilled in piloting Gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. While hunting for food, he attacks Kamina when he found, running into his Gunmen Enki after Yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. He manages to overcome Simon and Kamina's attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. The next day, Viral returns to execute his mission as member of the Human Execution Squad, facing Kamina and Simon again; this time however, Viral is defeated by the newly formed Gurren-Lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on Kamina for his humiliation when he took Enki's helmet in the fight.\n\nViral later returns alongside Supreme General Thymilph and the Dai-Gunzan to crush Team Gurren with the upgraded Enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the Dai-Gurren's capture and the death of his superior. He tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join Supreme General Adiane's side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for Thymilph's demise. Still, Viral saved Adiane from harm during a fight with Team Dai-Gurren, by stopping the Dai-Gurren's foot from crushing her. After Adiane's death by the Dai-Gurren's attack and being the only survivor of the Dai-Gunkai, Viral curses the Gurren-Lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor.\n\nUnder Supreme General Cytomander's command, Viral took part on the aerial attack on the Dai-Gurren. His battle with the Gurren-Lagann, piloted by Simon and Yoko, extended to the control room of Cytomander's aerial fortress, the Dai-Gunten. There, he learned of Kamina's death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging Simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. But the battle was interrupted by Cytomander, who took Yoko hostage, and ordered Viral to destroy the defenseless Gurren-Lagann. However, Viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. For this action, Cytomander asked the Spiral King's permission to execute him for treason, but Viral's last request was hearing from the King himself of what is the true nature of human race. Thus, Lord Genome dispenses Cytomander and conducts Viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the Beastmen's existance before making him immortal. Viral's last effort against the Gurren-Lagann was in the Spiral King's throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. Lord Genome revealed that the reason he gave Viral immortality was not to fight against Simon, as none without \"Spiral Energy\" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against Team Dai-Gurren.\n\n\nViral's name comes directly from the word \"viral,\" tying in with the Beastmen's genetics theme, but there are other theories about his name's origin. One is the fact that it can also be an anagram for \"rival,\" referring to his constant rivalry with Kamina, which transfered to Simon throughout the series until near the end. Another possible theory comes from the Nikopol Trilogy of comic books written by Enki Bilal, as Enki is the name of Viral's first Gunmen and \"Bilal,\" pronounced in Japanese, sounds like \"Viral.\" Supporting this theory is Viral's theme song, which is titled \"Nikopol,\" on the anime's soundtrack.\n\nThe name of Viral's Gunmen may be tied to the Sumerian diety Enki, though it is much more likely that there is a deliberate connection between his second Gunmen, Enkidu, and the character of Enkidu from the Epic of Gilgamesh. The myth consists of Enkidu (\"Enki's creation\"), a man of the wild who seeks to challenge King Gilgamesh, a mighty warrior, but who later befriends him and assists him in in his travels."}

{"mal_id": 2213, "name": "Arcueid Brunestud", "description": "Birthday: December 25\nHeight: 167cm\nWeight: 52kg\nThree sizes: B88/W55/H85\nHair color: Blond\nEye color: Red/Gold (Mystic Eyes activated)\n\nArcueid Brunestud is the White Princess of the True Ancestors. The title of Brunestud was given to those True Ancestors capable of manifesting the Millennium Castle Brunestud, and has been likened to be the vampire royal family, although this is not strictly true. The True Ancestors were a race of beings copied from TYPE-MOON, the ultimate being of the moon, also known as the Crimson Moon. Long ago the planet had no defense mechanism against humanity, nothing to keep them in check. Thus the Crimson Moon came down and offered to help the planet make a race of ultimate beings to rule over humanity, thus resulting in them being the 'consciousness of the planet.' True Ancestors are likened to occurrences such as earthquakes and typhoons rather than individuals as their \"...actions, while evil and without justification, would come as naturally to her (Arcueid and other True Ancestors) as breathing.\" However the race was fundamentally flawed, they had a desire to drink blood that the original, the Crimson Moon had. The True Ancestors needed to use a large portion of their power to suppress this impulse, but as there was no cure, and with passage of time the impulse grew, more and more True Ancestors fell and began drinking blood indiscriminately, while others most likely went into eternal sleep.\nThe True Ancestors didn't have a specific reason in creating Arcueid. They normally only mold new True Ancestors to fit specific needs. There was no need for a being as strong as her, but in the end, she originated from nothingness, simply as a product to realize the pointless goal of \"the strongest True Ancestor.\" They used her great strength to make her into a weapon, the executioner of the fallen True Ancestors and of the most powerful Dead Apostles. According to Ciel, this happened in the 12th century AD, when the number of fallen True Ancestors was very high. She was able to perform this duty splendidly, but she was nothing more than a tool. She was taught nothing beyond what she needed to know to hunt her targets, to the extent that she even ignored the fact that she was the same kind of creature as those she was supposed to destroy, and went to sleep after every kill, with her accumulated memories erased.\n\nAs the executioner, she did not have any vampiric impulses, and the rest of the True Ancestors also believed she had none. A priest from the church seeking perfect immortality, Michael Roa Valdamjong, needed to become a Dead Apostle to continue his research as he had already reached the potential of his human body. Arcueid, ignorant of her nature as a vampire and the consequences of drinking blood, was easily tricked by Roa into drinking his and turned berserk, wiping out most of the True Ancestors, turning Roa into one of the strongest Dead Apostles and having a considerable portion of her power stolen by him, before she managed to regain her sanity long enough to chain herself to the throne and go to sleep. From then on she had to suppress her urge to drink blood like any other True Ancestors. The rest of the True Ancestors were wiped out either by Roa or the rest of the Dead Apostles, who made a game of trying to assassinate their creators.\n\nArcueid finally managed to destroy Roa's original body, although it took an alliance with the Burial Agency to do it. Roa was not killed however, as he had managed to master reincarnation, and constantly reincarnated into host bodies he chose before his deaths. These host bodies were chosen for a mix of social standing (rich families with influence) and the physical/magical potential of the body. After destroying Roa's original body, Arcueid went to sleep and awoke only to kill Roa's re-incarnations constantly, but was never able to destroy him and get her power back as he would simply re-incarnate each time. At the time of Tsukihime, Roa had re-incarnated 17 times, with his last re-incarnation being Tohno SHIKI.\n\n(Source: Type-Moon Wiki)"}

With the exception of these two and Yūko, Watanuki tends to address everyone around him with formality and kindness.\n\nOne of Watanuki's greater problems, especially early on in the manga, is his lack of self-worth.

She is also a protagonist of Date AST Like, a spin-off manga which focuses on her relationship with Mikie in the AST, as well as the main character of Date A Origami, a 4-koma comic strip manga which focuses on the romantic comedy aspect of the main series.\n\nOrigami is a top student in her school both in terms of academics and sports. Of course, none of the student body and facility members know that she is a member of the AST with a few exceptions unknown to her. Origami is a very skilled wizard but can lose herself in her emotions when it comes to dealing with Spirits in combat. Origami is in love with Shidouu, her love for Shidouu is greatly high that she stalks him.\n\n\n\nOrigami is shown as a young female with short, silvery-white hair arranged in a bob cut with three hair-clips in the left part of her hair. She has blue eyes and wears the girl uniform like her female classmates when at school.\n\nHowever, in her AST Combat Wiring Suit, her appearance is more fierce. Origami's clips are not worn, instead a pair of sensors are attached to her hair with armor covering her from shoulder to hand as well as part of her body and legs but not thighs. Her chest is seen at the top of the transparent suit as well as revealing her belly.\n\nOrigami is a person that rarely openly talks with other people unless needed with only a few exceptions such as Shidou Itsuka and Tooka Yatogami. She isn't a shy person, but more of an unsocial type of person. She can be a bit reckless or aggressive if she has a goal or purpose to fulfill.\n\n\nAs a wizard, She was the vanguard and current \"Ace\" for the AST. Her skills as a member of the AST were noted to be quite phenomenal, as she was the only one who at first could manage to fight a spirit close quarters(although she still lost), and she was also the most extreme, hoping to kill Yoshino by first dropping a building on her dome. She managed to utilise the CR-Unit &lt;White Licorice&gt;, which is noted to be very dangerous and dificult to handle, in fact, no one else but her has proven to be capable of using it long enough to actually put it to practical use. She was even able to land a hit on the world's most powerful Wizard, Ellen, which Ellen herself considers worthy of praise.\n\n\nOrigami one-sidedly proclaims herself as Shidou's girlfriend or lover unbeknownst to Shidouu himself. Origami uses any chance she gets to make her relationship with Shidou more intimate. Her love for him is quite unhealthy as she often disregards most of Shidou's feelings or opinions and can come off as self-centered.\n\nIn reality, Origami is a stalker with Shidou being the focus of her desires. She has secretly been following Shidou around in his everyday life since before the start of the series and has on many occasions tried seducing him with her actions, such as buying a new bed, making herself deliberately vulnerable, giving him a combination of strong energy drinks and preparing traps to entice him to her. However blunt she may be, Shidou has not acknowledged or reciprocated her feelings.\n\nOrigami has also proven to value Shidou's life over her loyalty to AST and DEM, going so far as to steal a dangerous CR-Unit from them and combat them specifically to protect him. She however, does not seem to value his emotions above her revenge, as while she does try to remove him physically from her fights with Kotori and the other spirits, she makes no attempt to stop or even consider his reaction to her killing them. This is especially evident in regards to Kotori, since she is Shidou's sister, while Origami later admitted she didn't want to kill Kotori, and readily believed Shidou when he said that it was a different spirit that killed her parents, it is clear that had Shidou not told her that then she would have without regret.\n\nOrigami sees Tooka as an enemy, love rival, and an annoying \"baka\" that gets in her way with Shidou. Origami shows little respect for her as the quarrel between them as Spirit and AST member remains unsettled despite the fact that Tooka's powers are sealed. Origami does not trust her very much as she views every other Spirit but is not hostile to her due to Tooka's currently sealed status.\n\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wikia)"}

Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).\n\nJet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\n\nDuring the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover."}

He uses the knowledge gained from cooking monsters to develop techniques to defeat them, but is also shown to have certain mythology and biological factors of them memorized, as shown with the dragons in the fight with the Lunatic Magician. He is a very calm and gentle person but gets very passionate when he talks about monsters, which irritates most of the people around him. He tends to speak very quickly when excited and makes animated hand gestures as well as facial expressions, a complete 180 from his usual demeanor.\n\nThough he's intelligent and passionate when it comes to monsters, as well as talented with combat, he falters in most situations outside of the dungeon. He's shown to struggle with other people, missing social cues and being overly blunt, which often leads to arguments with others.\n\nDespite having good intentions and seeing most people as his friends, those same people are uncomfortable around Laios and see him as someone who has the potential to become \"evil\" due to not understanding him. Though this struggle persists throughout the series, he stays extremely friendly and accepting towards others, even if they do not do the same for him, being quick to forge friendships with other groups and even orcs. Possibly due to his indifference towards most living things other than monsters, he doesn't really see a difference between himself and other races, including the orcs.\n\nDespite his deep love and admiration of monsters he has no illusions to the threat they pose. If anything his reverence of them has made him extra cautious to them.\n\nHis favorite foods are dairy products, especially cheesecake, and his least favorite type of foods are squid/octopus.\n\n(Source: Delicious in Dungeon Wiki)"}
{"mal_id": 5103, "name": "King Bradley", "description": "King Bradley is the Führer of the Amestris state military and has all state alchemist under his direct command. King Bradley almost always maintains a kind and calm demeanor even when issuing orders to engage in battle. This trait often confuses his subordinates, and Roy Mustang admits that he \"can't figure the guy out.\" King Bradley has a son, Selim, and an unnamed wife.\n\n\nIn the 2003 anime series, the Führer maintains his role as the president of the country. Although he is a carefree man, he has a mind like a steel trap and his personality can change rapidly. It was he who finished the Ishval Civil War by sending in the State Alchemists to end it.\n\n\nIn the manga and 2009 anime series, he has a slightly strange sense of humor and has a habit of doing rather odd things for someone of his status. Such things as joking with his subordinates, dressing-up as a tourist while visiting Dublith to meet Izumi Curtis, giving watermelons as gifts to Edward Elric, ditching work to meet the brothers in the hospital, and jumping out of a window to get away from his attendants.\n\n\n(Source: Fullmetal Alchemist Wikia)"}

{"mal_id": 3149, "name": "Tobi", "description": "Tobi was formerly Zetsu's subordinate, and became a full Akatsuki member after Sasori's death. He now wears the same ring as Sasori, having recovered it after Sasori's death, and took his place as Deidara's partner. Unlike the majority of ninja thus far, Tobi has not been shown wearing a visible forehead protector, so his place of origin is unknown. He wears an orange mask with single eye-hole covered in a swirl pattern concentrated towards the right eye. This odd mask that covers his entire face save for his right eye. Furthermore, Tobi has several bolts or pins present on the arms of his uniform, now obscured by his Akatsuki cloak.\n\nTobi's area of expertise remains unclear, as he has never been shown fighting. He and Deidara have defeated the three-tailed beast, but Tobi is never shown doing anything but running from it. After the battle, which goes largely unwitnessed, Tobi claims to have knocked it out with a single attack. Deidara disagrees with the assessment, claiming that it was his \"artistic contribution\" (exploding clay) that allowed them to win. During his fight with Sasuke, Tobi shows the ability to recover from what are presumably debilitating or fatal blows. After being slashed across the midsection by Sasuke's sword, Tobi collapses, only to stand up again a few seconds later and complain about the speed of the attack. Aside from this, Tobi has yet to demonstrate any techniques.\n\nTobi has a very formal and correct manner of speech. While his physical appearance remains a mystery, Zetsu has implied that he is relatively young when one side of him referred to Tobi as a \"good boy.\" He respects Deidara, referring to him as Deidara-senpai. Tobi's personality is rather odd in comparison with other Akatsuki members. While most of the members are dedicated and serious, though somewhat argumentative or even hostile towards each other when not fighting, Tobi is more carefree and goofy, much like Naruto. His personality does not please Deidara, who believes that all Akatsuki members should be serious and calm. Tobi unintentionally irritates Deidara frequently, which usually results in Deidara attacking Tobi in a comedic fashion."}

He distrusted Aizen from the day they met, and thus made him lieutenant so he could keep an eye on him. Because Shinji never socialized with Aizen, however, he was easily deceived by Aizen's actions, culminating to his conversion into a hollow. Shinji's character is somewhat comical, adding a bit of levity to situations that are otherwise serious. He seems to like annoying his associate, Hiyori Sarugaki, which usually earns him a slap from one of her sandals. He also appears to have a history of referring to cute girls he meets as his 'first love', complete with a deadpan look on his face despite the obvious lie (he apparently never did this with Hiyori, further annoying her). An early design of Shinji can be seen in the first chapter's cover art, making it clear he was planned well before his introduction. During several points in the anime, Shinji's outfit is depicted to look like Lupin the III, likely as a homage on the part of the animators.\n\nShinji's hollow mask resembles a pharaoh's mask. Shinji is quite skilled with his hollow powers, using a single cero blast to easily overwhelm Grimmjow Jeagerjaques. The video games also depict him being able to split the cero blasts into a pyramid shaped attack.\n\nShinji's zanpakutō, Sakanade (逆撫) has the power of creating an inverted world. The power is an optical illusion which is caused by the scent the sword gives off upon its release. It inverts an opponent's sense of direction causing the directions of up and down, left and right as well as forward and backward becoming the opposite. It is not just the sense of direction that is changed; the opponent's eyesight and where they get cut is reversed as well.\n\nIn its sealed form, Sakanade resembles a normal katana with red hilt and sheath whereas upon its release, its hilt becomes a large ring which Shinji places his hand in the middle of allowing him to freely control its movement without physically holding onto it if he so chooses. The ring is attached to a normal sword hilt with a normal rectangular hand guard. The first few inches of the blade are covered by as extension of the hand guard. Sakanade's blade is straight and slim with the tip ending in a slanted razor-like edge instead of being tapered to a point. There are five holes along the swords length.\n\nHe has a tattoo on his tongue, as seen in episode 142.\n\n\n(Source: Bleach official character book II)"}

{"mal_id": 2473, "name": "Satoshi", "description": "Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in Japan) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the japanese animation, Pokémon. There are also incarnations of him in the Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, the Pocket Monsters Zensho manga, and the Ash &amp; Pikachu manga. He is loosely based on the male protagonist of the Pokémon Red and Blue. The family name \"Ketchum\" is a pun of the anime's former tagline and slogan \"Gotta catch 'em all!\"\n\nAt the beginning of the series, Ash was 10 years old. In the short called \"Pikachu &amp; Pichu\" which was attached to Pokémon 3: The Movie, he said the day when the events depicted in the short took place was the day he met Pikachu, meaning his age at that time would be at least 11. However, two seasons later, the official Japanese Pokémon website reported that Ash was the same age as May, who was 10 years old at the time. This and the fact that the two are at the same height suggests that none of the characters have aged since the show began, placing the Pokemon anime in a floating timeline.\n\nAsh is a caring and valiant trainer but he can be confident to the point of arrogance and is known for being stubborn at times. He also has quite the reckless streak, which has led him to troublesome situations and even near death. But when in a Pokémon battle, he is highly competitive, and he shows tremendous presence of mind, taking advantage of the battlefield as well the nature of his and the enemy Pokémon's moves to claim victory after victory, though he has been known to lose from time to time.\n\nAsh has matured greatly over the course of the series, and has considerably improved his abilities as a trainer, but his earnestness and determination remain the same. During the first season of the series, Ash trained to catch more Pokémon than his childhood rival, Gary Oak, although Gary has caught more. He soon begins to focus more on each of his Pokémon's abilities. He also impresses many trainers by winning battles in which his Pokémon has a type disadvantage. At the Johto League Silver Conference Ash finally won a battle against Gary.\n\nThroughout the anime, Ash has met a number of rivals, including Richie, whom he faced in the Indigo League, and Casey, a diehard Electabuzz fanatic. During Pokémon tournaments, Ash has made rivals out of Harrison, Jackson, Morrison, and Tyson (the last of which went on to become the champion of the Hoenn Pokémon league). Near the beginning of Pokémon: Diamond &amp; Pearl, Ash meets an arrogant young trainer named Paul, who quickly becomes his new rival.\n\nAsh's primary nemesis is a group of comical antagonists named Team Rocket. Ever since the second episode, \"Pokémon Emergency!\" two Team Rocket operatives named Jessie and James, along with a talking Meowth, have always tried to steal his first Pokémon Pikachu but have always failed. There are some occasions when they work together like the Pokémon: The Movie 2000.\n\nAsh's mother is Delia Ketchum (Hanako in Japan). She is a caring and thoughtful woman, though occasionally oblivious as her son, and in the English version of the anime often pesters him to change his boxer shorts every day, a gag throughout the early episodes of the first few series.\n\nThe identity of his father has remained unknown. One reference to him exists in the anime. During a phone conversation between Ash and his mother in the second episode, she states to her amazement that he got from Pallet Town to Viridian City in one day. \"It took your father four days to get there when he started Pokémon training,\" she says, \"He'll be so proud!\" A line from the play, Pokémon Live!, suggests that Delia, at one time, had a relationship with the leader of Team Rocket, Giovanni when she was a teenager, but in the anime, no evidence of Giovanni being Ash's father has been shown currently.\n\nIn the episode \"Showdown at Dark City,\" Ash went by the name of Tom Ato (tomato) after spotting some ketchup that Pikachu was eating. He had to disguise his name, so that his real name would not get a bad reputation, since he was dealing with the rivaling Yas and Kas gyms.\n\nAsh was based off Red, a playable character from the generation l games, Pokémon Red, Blue and Green, he was also based off Satoshi Tajiri's childhood self."}

Seiei is the main protagonist of the story in Gundam 00. He's a Gundam Meister of Celestial Being. In season 1, he pilots GN-001 Gundam Exia and later to GN-0000 00 Gundam in season 2. In the movie, he pilots 00 Qan[T]~-start-25-stop \nHis name could also be denoted to state his personality. Translated it could mean To obtain the moment.\n\nSetsuna is taciturn, introverted, and righteous against war. He believes there are key disturbances that affect the world from coming together in peace and harmony. He labeled specific people and/or forces as a source of conflict towards the world's path to peace. He has little tolerance for diplomats and politicians, believing that their negotiations only prolong wars and cause more strife (due to personal experience). He's got a vendetta to settle and his past battle experiences stirs old bitter feelings, increasing his combat potential as a beneficial side effect. Though a self proclaimed atheist, he often questions the motivations of God with people and worldly events. He idolizes the Gundams so much that he wants to embody Exia as himself, a Gundam. He's a traditionalist in honor and a martyr for his cause in Celestial Being. \n\nIn a letter to Marina Ismail, he revealed more in depth into his feelings and thinking. Setsuna wanted to understand the lesser aspects of humanity. He wanted to know why the world is filled with people with innate dark intentions and inconsiderate of other people's suffering. He wanted to find these answers with his Gundam in hopes to bring mutual understanding and peace.\n \nAfter a 5 year hiatus, Setsuna has taken an unofficial role as the leader of the Gundam Meisters. He's now able to assert and express his feelings to people without reservation. Setsuna's ideals are still the same, but his recent experiences lead him to believe the importance of self change and the need to fight for a better future. His determination and strong self confidence motivates and inspires people around him. He's more understanding and compromising, but also capable making hard-but necessary-decisions that would lead people to dislike him. He has no problems making life defining decisions for other people when they can't make the choice and would kill if necessary. \n\nSetsuna is skilled in many ways of war. Trained by Ali Al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, use of explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare by the age of 10. As Celestial Being's Gundam Meister, he uses his former combat training in his KPSA days to reflect Exia's combat style. He's been trained by Celestial Being to know limited MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam. His 5 year hiatus with Celestial Being didn't dull his piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed improvement.\n\n\nSkills &amp; Capabilities\nSetsuna is skilled in many ways of war and fighting. Trained by Ali al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, use of explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare by the age of 10. As CB's Gundam Meister, he uses his former combat training in his KPSA days to reflect Exia's combat style. He's been trained by CB to know some MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam.\nHis 4 year hiatus (AD 2312 - Season 2) with Celestial Being didn't dull his MS piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed great improvement. Due to the power of 00 Gundam's concentrated GN particles with Trans-Am Raiser, Setsuna's brain has been gradually enhanced to utilize quantum brainwaves. He's able to sense quantum brainwaves (QBWs) near him and track users of QBWs. Eventually, he naturally evolves into humanity's first true/genuine Innovator.\n\nSetsuna's Innovator capabilities aren't completely defined as he's the first naturally evolved Innovator. It has yet to be revealed if he can communicate with Veda or Celestial Being technology like the Innovades can. He can anticipate movements and actions of his opponents and sense impending danger from far distances. As an Innovator, he has heightened reflexes, a longer lifespan than normal humans, and can communicate his thoughts via quantum brainwaves.\n\nAfter Setsuna joined the ELS, his body is not entirely human. The ELS reformed his body based on their bio-technology, forever retaining his youthful appearance with a metallic shine. It can be inferred that Setsuna became a hybrid of a Innovator and a ELS."}

{"mal_id": 137, "name": "Saito Hiraga", "description": "Age: 17\nHeight: 172 cm (5'8\")\nBirthday: December 9th\nFavorite Food: Teriyaki Burgers\nHobbies: The Internet\nSpecial Skills: Good with Action Games, Swordsmanship \nHates: His P.E. Teacher\nWeapon: Delflinger (デルフリンガー), a sentient sword\n\nSaito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.\n\nThere are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.\n\nThe series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.\n\nSaito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.\n\nAlthough he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his \"snobbish\" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name \"My Louise\" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.\n\nHis partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming \"All that he is good at is protecting her.\" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname \"Our Sword\" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as \"ability man.\""}

Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of \"Father\" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou's attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than \"Father\". Suigintou's desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.\n\nSuigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Träumend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Träumend finale, she tells Shinku that \"Father\" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.\n\n\n\nAlong with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou's weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle. The variety in Suigintou's abilities, particularly when combined with her savagely cunning nature, makes her a strong player in the Alice Game.\n\nMedium: None (First Season)/Megu (Second Season)\n\nSuigintou's name in English means, \"Mercury Lamp\"."}

I'm not Yoshinon. I'm Yoshino. Yoshinon is my best friend.\"\n\nYoshino is a spirit and an important character in Date A Live series. She is the second Spirit saved by Shido. Yoshino is a shy girl who is said to be the Kindest spirit up to date. Her codename is Hermit.\n\nWhen Yoshino first appeared in the series, it was also when she first encountered Shidou. To Shidou, Yoshino appeared to be a lost child wandering around in the rain. The next time they met, Yoshino fell under attack from the AST and ran away. The third time they met was when Shidou made the decision to save Yoshino from herself and from the AST for he discovered that Yoshino was an extremely kind child even towards the people who were hunting and attacking her.\n\nAfter having most of her power sealed by Shidou, Yoshino started living in one of Ratatoskr's living quarters on Fraxinus temporarily before she moved down to the apartment complex next to Shidou's home. Yoshino is currently practicing with the help from Ratatoskr how to speak for herself, or to be more precise, how to speak without the aid of Yoshinon.\n\nYoshino has the appearance of a young girl, at about 13 to 14 years of age, with blue eyes and hair, wearing a light-blue short dress and outside, wearing a large green raincoat with a pair of rabbit-ear hood, holding a rabbit puppet, Yoshinon, in her left hand. The raincoat seems to have a tail with a pink ribbon attaching to it. Her preferred form of clothing appears to be sundresses along with boots that match her raincoat.\n\nAfter her spirit power was sealed, the dress under her raincoat is the one she is wearing now, adding a hat with a ribbon attach to it and still holding Yoshinon, her puppet. Yoshinon is a mischievous white rabbit puppet that Yoshino always holds in her left hand. Yoshinon's right eye has a black button with a brown band that resembles a eyepatch, while its left eye is a very small pink dot.\n\nAt her first appearance, Yoshino is a very shy girl, unable to articulate full sentences and express herself well. Other than Yoshino, she has her other personality named Yoshinon which is the rabbit in her left arm. Yoshino says it's her hero for protecting her from bad guys (which are the ASTs). It is also said that Yoshino created Yoshinon in order to restrain herself from hurting humans. As she lets Yoshinon do the talking for her with its outgoing personality. She improves after Shidou seals her powers and begins learning to integrate herself into society. Later in the story, most of the time Yoshino will force herself to speak personally while conversing with Shidou, instead of using her puppet Yoshinon.\n\nYoshino has the ability to manipulate all states of water (solid, liquid, and gas) in her surrounding area. She usually uses her powers for defensive purposes only due to her kind and shy nature.\n\nHer Angel, Zadkiel, is a huge puppet that resembles Yoshinon. Zadkiel has two forms, the first form resembles Yoshinon but is a lot bigger, with one red round eye and an eyepatch, large sharp teeth, and white skin. In this form, Zadkiel has the ability to absorb water from the ground and air and release it in the form of an attack. Yoshinon is also able to talk through the puppet, and acts as a limiter to suppress the Angel's powers so that it doesn't end up killing anyone. Zadkiel's second form appears to be its true form, this form also resembles Yoshinon but is even larger than when Yoshinon becomes Zadkiel. The second form is larger than a many-story building, and does not have an eyepatch. This Zadkiel has the same powers as the other but is a lot more powerful. Even Yoshino has problems controlling the Angel.\n\nWhen using Sirion, Yoshino fuses with Zadkiel, gaining an ice armour over her Astral Dress. Her powers over water and ice increased to the point of the surrounding area being frozen. Shido remarked that she looked like she was wearing Zadkiel.\n\nBeing a passive Spirit, Yoshino prefers to take non-aggressive actions such as running and hiding as opposed to engaging in combat against her enemies. Yoshino's Astral Dress is named El, and has enough defensive power to block an AST missile barrage.\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wiki)"}

However, despite the charming and affable demeanor he puts on, he is an extremely angry and vengeful man, having carried homicidal ideations towards others.

However, later on in the series, he takes on a more supportive role for the series' main characters, becoming somewhat of an ally rather than an enemy, though he prefers to not consider himself as one of their allies.\n\nDespite often being shown with a playful smile, Mukuro is seemingly apathetic to the suffering of others. Appearing as the series' first antagonist, Mukuro is not averse to disposing of those who get in his way, and is not easily intimidated, usually speaking to others in a very direct and arrogant manner. He cares little for others, and simply considers people to be \"toys\" or \"tools\" he can sacrifice in order to get to what he wants. \n\nMukuro is implied to have a strong dislike for the entire Mafia underground, due in part to the experimentations he suffered as a child at the hands of the Estraneo Mafia family. When Mukuro killed his captors, he offered Chikusa and Ken, who were also victims of experimentation, a chance to join him in his quest to destroy the world. However, not only does he want to take revenge on the Mafia by destroying it, he also wants to cleanse the world of its filth by invoking universal suffering through a world war."}

{"mal_id": 3891, "name": "Pikachu", "description": "Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.\n\nIn the Pokémon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye (EP039), wild Pikachu are shown to live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In A Plethora of Pikachu! (SM091), it is shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric-type Pokémon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by . While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\n\nPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the Pokémon the Series episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite (EP030), Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to . As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.\n\nForms\nPikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.\n\nCosplay Pikachu\nCosplay Pikachu is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions.\n\nPikachu in a cap\nPikachu in a cap is always male and has eight variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from Pokémon the Series. Pikachu in a cap is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Pikachu in a Cap cannot use Catastropika or Gigantamax.\n\nPartner Pikachu\nThe partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender. It has higher base stats than normal Pikachu. Unlike other Pikachu, the partner Pikachu can learn the exclusive moves Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, and Splishy Splash, as well as having access to the Partner Power Pika Papow.\n\nThe partner Pikachu is not differentiated from standard Pikachu in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!'s Pokédex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.\n\nGigantamax Pikachu\nAs Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.\n\nEvolution\nPikachu evolves from  and evolves into .\nIn Alola, it evolves into Alolan Raichu.\nCosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, Partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.\n\n(Source: Bulbapedia)"}
{"mal_id": 778, "name": "Tyki Mikk", "description": "Shortly after Allen meets Arystar and recruits him into becoming an ally, he met Tyki. The man lives a double life: his \"white side\" that is a carefree and goofy man of Portuguese descent who travels with humans that love to play poker, and his sadistic \"dark side\" that has a lust for blood and takes up his role as Noah's descendant (and therefore, one of the antagonists).\n\nTyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs.\n\nThe author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross.\n\nTyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air.\n\nHis powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds.\nHe also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight).\n\nHe usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades.\nHe was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry."}

This attitude can be traced back to her childhood, given that the boys in her class would sexually harass her classmates by flipping their skirts, and picking on her friends. Yui took it upon herself to stand up for her classmates and came to detest boys and shamelessness as a result.\n\nShe quickly comes at odds with Lala and her free-spirited personality, which she sees as a hindrance towards making the school a more peaceful and better place. Likewise, she has a certain distaste for Rito, given that his frequent mishaps lead to misunderstandings concerning his true nature. At first, she believes him to be just another shameless pervert, but gradually she begins understanding this is not the case.\n\nEventually, she loosens up a bit, but she's generally more on her guard than the other girls. She becomes a part of Rito's harem all the same.\n\nIn the anime version it is also implied (albeit rather briefly) that she might have feelings for Rito. In the original manga version, however, this is made evident, to the point she even fantasizes about marrying Rito and adopting Celine as her own child. This also causes her attitude to shift, especially in the latter half of the manga, where she mellows out a lot, especially around Rito.\n\nIt should be noted that there is a huge rift in terms of how her personality is portrayed between the anime and the manga, especially in the first season where Yui is depicted as far stricter and harsher than she really is. Her introduction episode in the anime makes a very radical departure to her portrayal in the manga, depicting her as extremely puritanical and authoritarian. This is eventually toned down but this initial portrayal has also caused such a reputation to stick among anime-only viewers. \n\nLikewise, a good deal of her scenes from the manga concerning her character development have either remained unadapted or given to Haruna instead. For example, in the OVAs it's Rito and Haruna who travel together to the fantasy RPG crafted by Lala's sisters, however, in the source material this role was originally given to Yui. It is uncertain why the directors chose to diminish her role in the series, given her popularity among the fanbase. \n\nIn the post-manga interview the authors Saki Hasemi and Kentaro Yabuki declared she was introduced as the only character meant to develop, in contrast to the rest of the cast which were written to sort of \"reset\" with each chapter, given the slice-of-life setting. This changed in To Love Ru Darkness, which was more story-driven, were most characters are given some sort of development."}

Uryuu Ishida is a dark blue-haired, bespectacled teenager of average height. At school, Uryuu wears the school uniform along with a tie, while outside he dons white Quincy clothes with blue stripes representing the Quincy cross, and a mantle.\n\nUryuu is generally shy and quiet, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. For example, during the Soul Society arc he wears a mantle that serves no purpose other than to make him look cooler, despite the fact that it hinders his movement. He even keeps a spare to that effect. In addition, he also has a tendency to say things with characteristic drama.\nUryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the \"Pride of the Quincy\" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. He demonstrates this at multiple points throughout the series, such as when he tried to defend Rukia Kuchiki from Renji Abarai when he and Byakuya Kuchiki came to the real world to take her, or when he defends Orihime Inoue at multiple points throughout the Soul Society arc. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.\n\nUryuu does not hold his father, Ryuuken Ishida, in high respect; he calls his father by his given name which is considered very rude in Japanese society. Despite this, in the anime Uryuu seems mildly offended when Rukia commented that the Ishida's hospital (his father being the present director) is falling apart and Renji replies tactlessly that the hospital is only for show.\n\nUryuu has low blood pressure and hates procrastination. The other things he hates are quite odd: buttons (despite being an expert in sewing) and the word \"haphazard.\" His favorite food is homemade mackerel miso stew. The television program he likes is Don Kanonji's \"Bura-Rei.\" The shadow that jumped out of the crowd at Kanonji's first appearance was in fact Uryuu. Like his grandfather, Sōken Ishida, Uryuu is left-handed."}

Because of his status and power, defeating him is Roronoa Zoro's ultimate goal. Mihawk is so strong, in fact, he is accused by some characters (and fans) of having the power of a Devil Fruit; however, nothing has stated anything but that his abilities simply come from pure skill and power.\n\nHe wields the Black Sword Yoru, the strongest sword in the world. It's an ornately decorated, man-sized (6 feet) sword shaped like a cross with a shiny black blade, curved at the end. It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck.\n\nIn appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword. He is easily compared to the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts, AKA Black Bart, who also donned a crimson overcoat, a wide brimmed hat with a red feather, and a diamond cross attached to a gold chain around his neck. Mihawk travels around in a coffin-shaped raft with two green-flamed candles, a single black sail, and a single seat. The fact that he can traverse across the unforgiving oceans, as well as the Grand Line itself, in such a meager craft is yet another testament to his abilities.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

{"mal_id": 2653, "name": "Batou", "description": "Batou (also Batto, Bato) is nominally the second-in-command of Section 9.  Little is known about the strange, large foreigner who has been with Motoko Kusanagi for years.  He was once American and served in the Special Forces in South America.  His amount of cyborg-ization is variable according to the storyline, from his limbs only up to most of his body, second only to the Major herself.  Despite the availability of superior eyes, he grew superstitious about his old-style eye replacements, popular with many high-level military operatives.  He also retains some residual body-image issues, causing him to continually purchase workout equipment despite the obvious anachronism.\n\nIn the two Stand Alone Complex series, Batou's personality is more like that in the manga version. He is an outgoing joker, but one with a quick temper. Being emotional and not as calm as the Major, Batou shows anger at injustice and cruelty, to the point of seeming downright hotheaded at times. He sometimes shows impatience with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa, to the point of rudeness, and jokes with him constantly.\n\nAt times, he is also shown to be a voice of reason and concern for the Major, to the point that she admits she can confide in him. Both seasons of the anime, like the movies, hint at some romantic tension between the two, particularly near the end of each Gig. This tension is touched upon, briefly, in the Solid State Society movie, where Batou admits that he's been covering up any of the Major's appearances in cases prior to the Puppet Master case.\n\nBatou had served in a military special forces team before entering Section 9. Most of his body is comprised of cybernetic prosthetics. Despite the fact that exercise will do his cybernetic body parts no benefits, Batou lifts weights as a hobby. Based on several of the Stand Alone Complex episodes, Batou seems to have served in the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force at some point before he joined Section 9. It is suggested several times that he held a JGSDF Ranger qualification. His unit was involved in World War IV and was deployed to South America alongside Motoko Kusanagi, where they accidentally stumbled across an American Imperial Navy unit conducting a covert operation codenamed \"Project Sunset,\" which consisted of soldiers earning the trust of communities and then carrying out war crimes, spreading terror and chaos in the enemy ranks. Batou's eyes are grey and clearly prosthetic. They are standard cybernetic equipment issued to Ranger Special Forces operatives."}

Currently known as the Aqua Deer to fans of the show, Julius's squad possessed a number of notable characters. At some point, the Wizard King was chosen to lead the squad.\n\nAs Captain, Julius recruited Yami Sukehiro, current captain of the Black Bulls. Despite Yami being a foreigner who was ostracized by the kingdom, Julus recognized his potential. The two grew close and their friendship is a highlight of the show. Surprising to some viewers, Julius Novachrono didn't always want to become Wizard King. As a Royal Knight, he was happy in his role as it allowed him to satisfy his obsession with magic and meet powerful mages in the process.\n\nAs expected from the giant nerd, Julius possesses an incredible amount of magical knowledge, far surpassing that of the Magic Knights Captains.

But even Julius has his limits, such as when he was surprised by Asta's anti-magic sword.\n\nDon't let his happy-go-lucky attitude deceive you, Julius can be ruthless when required. Throughout the anime, the Wizard King demonstrates kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. Even when fighting Patolli, Julius preferred to capture him alive in order to save William's body.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that he is soft. When the Eye of The Midnight Sun attacked the kingdom and captured Asta, in the blink of an eye Julius killed two members of the terrorist organization. The man is willing to take a life in order to save those he cares about.\n\n(Source: CBR)"}

This Persona is later transformed into Izanagi-no-Okami of the World arcana, the game's most powerful Persona. \n\nThe Protagonist also has a unique \"wild card\" ability to swap Personas, similar to the main characters of previous Persona games, but without the power of Death at his hand, he cannot use Fusion spells like the Protagonist of Persona 3.\n\nThe characters of the story give the Protagonist titles \"senpai\", \"sensei\", \"leader\", \"partner\", \"big bro\" when directly talking to him, instead of the usual \"you\" or \"him\" like his predecessors.\n\nThe character design of the Protagonist stayed relatively similar from initial conception, with his tone and expressions changing the most."}

Once she no longer has an immediate use for a man, she'll discard him, a pattern that has led to several of her deaths. She's also jealous when attention is given to other women, and work to break up established couples if presented an opening. Extremely self-centered, she thinks nothing of manipulating others for her pleasure.\n\nLittle is known of Tomie's true background, not even her family name. It is not known how she gained her powers, or even if she was aware of them prior to 1986. According to witnesses, she aged normally to that point, and seemed a standard if very pretty and flirtatious girl. On a field trip to Inariyawa, a small mountain near her school, Tomie was pressuring a teacher she'd been having sex with to leave his wife and marry her, when a male classmate who'd become obsessed with Tomie accosted her. She taunted the boy, and in the ensuing scuffle, Tomie fell over a cliff. Believing Tomie dead, the teacher decided to cover up the accident by chopping up the girl's body with the aid of the boys of the class. It turned out she wasn't quite dead, so this became a particularly gruesome task. The class then scattered the body parts where they would, in theory, not be found.\n\nSome parts were found, identified as Tomie's, and cremated. Her death was blamed on a psychopath, and a funeral was held. Which made it rather a shock when Tomie walked into class the next day as if nothing had happened. Her reappearance drove the more susceptible members of the class to madness, and when two of them tried to go to the police, the others turned violent in an attempt to stop them. Tomie disappeared shortly thereafter.\n\nTomie then began appearing in widely separated locations around Japan, inspiring men to passion and murder. She apparently died several more times, but always turned up alive again. Due to the police's stubborn refusal to credit these stories, no concerted effort was made to capture Tomie at least until 1995.\n\n(Source: herogames.com)"}

He was a Japanese salaryman for Asahi Industries in Tokyo until he was taken hostage by the crew of the Black Lagoon. He joined the Lagoon Company after his department chief, Kageyama, abandoned him in an attempt to cover up the smuggling operation in which Rock had been an unwitting participant. Rock is a humble and mild-mannered person despite being on the business end of guns from friend and foe alike, and often seems surprised at the barbarity of the Southeast Asian crime world. He still wears his tie, short-sleeved dress shirt, and dress pants because although now a pirate, he still retains his business persona. He prefers to use words over weapons when interacting with others. Rock, after joining the Lagoon company, has wondered if he is experiencing Stockholm syndrome.\n\nWithin the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in geology. He is also a skilled linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese (his native language) and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including Spanish, Romanian and Russian. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol, owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder-climbing salaryman. Rock's earnest personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan \"Jackpot\" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace, whom he trusts to the greatest degree. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more jaded teammates and as a bright spot in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them.\n\nRock is one of the \"luckiest\" characters in the series as he managed to survive every single thing he experienced from being taken hostage to being shot at. Thus far, he has survived the wrath of Revy, Balalaika, Roberta, and Sawyer. He is personally appointed by Mr. Chang to help Garcia Lovelace, much to Lagoon Company's disapproval. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption. Later, in a conversation with Fabiola, he demonstrates a darker, sadistically ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and the Roanapur environment. Benny even points out that there are things about him that scare almost everyone in Roanapur.\n\nWhile Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not seem to have much connection to them due to their somewhat apathetic attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the Showa period, according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975-1976."}

Her strength, speed, endurance, and instincts were honed to almost supernatural levels. An example being Roberta chasing down Lagoon company's getaway car and holding on by driving her knife into the rear of the car, nearly pulling the muscular Dutch out from his car, and accurately fire a large caliber sniper rifle from the hip with one arm.\n\nIt is ironic that while Roberta is one of the most powerful warrior-women in the story of Black Lagoon, she is also humane, possessing warmth, kindness, remorse, and family love for her master and his son.\n\nShe admitted that she did murder children, women or anyone in name of revolution during her FARC years.

Kenichi was frequently treated as a friendless loser at the beginning of the series, however it all changed when he met Furinji Miu. After the fateful meeting, he decided to stand for himself and be truly strong; or at least, strong enough to protect those who are dear to him. Though he's constantly considered cowardly at the beginning of the series, he shows that when his loved ones lives are on the line, he's actually much braver than he appears.\n\n\n\nOn his way to school one day Kenichi met Miu once again (though he did not recognize her) and the two soon became friends. Kenichi was a member of the school's karate club but was forced to do menial chores and was used as a punching bag until one day he stood up to a hulking student who tried to force him to quit and the two agreed to a match in which the loser will be forced to quit the club. With Miu's help he managed to win but quit the club anyway and drew unwanted attention from the club's president whom he fought twice managing an easy win the second time due to training he received at the Ryozanpaku dojo. However the trouble does not end for Kenichi as the club president had ties to a rising delinquent group known as Ragnarok who begin to take an interest in Kenichi. The manga follows Kenichi as he continues to train at, and eventually live at the Ryozanpaku dojo as well as facing increasingly more powerful foes.\n\nThough it is consistently stated that Kenichi has no talent for martial arts he more than makes up for it with his work ethic. It is due to this and the abnormally intense training regime he is forced to endure that Kenichi has gone from being considered the weakest student in his high school to being able to fight and defeat opponents with many years worth of skill as well as some with borderline superhuman abilities.\n\nKenichi is kind, compassionate, thoughtful, and moral to a fault. He is against violence and only studies martial arts to protect others, and also adheres to a strict code of morals and refuses to kill or hit women even if it means death. In spite of his strong moral standards however Kenichi can be quite perverted as he will jump at the chance to see Miu or Shigure bathing and also buys pictures of them from Ma (though these pictures are mostly fakes). He also adopted a \"fighting style\" from Ma called \"ecchi mode\" in which he attempts to grope women which strangely enough has actually helped him get out of a jam before. As a result of his kindness Kenichi has made many friends some of whom are former enemies and has even managed to unknowingly win the affections of Ma Renka and Li Raichi.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace, but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D has surprising power and resourcefulness, possessing most of the strengths and only mild levels of vampiric weaknesses. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a \"normal\" human, though marked by his unearthly beauty and powerful aura, and thus rarely accepted by humans. His only notable weaknesses are that he is, while not unfeeling, emotionally remote but sometimes sentimental. He is also (far more rarely than other dhampirs) randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years. Otherwise, D does not suffer from vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, possessing an imposing supernatural aura to his opponents and godlike reflexes surpassing even vampires.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

Ryou is a combat expert, having fought as a guerrilla in numerous conflicts alluded to throughout the series, and has a long history of working in the underground. He carries a Colt Python. His mysterious past starts with him being the only survivor of a plane crash in Central America as a toddler. The crash left him an orphan in a rebel village during a civil war, prompting him to learn to fight at a young age. As a result, he has very little information on his true parentage, or even his birthdate. (Later, Kaori Makimura unilaterally declared March 26 his birthday, as that was the day they first met). After the war he ended up in the United States, where he worked as a hired gun, but eventually he found his way to Tokyo, Japan. There he formed the \"City Hunter\" team with Hideyuki Makimura (Kaori's brother), and it's sometime after that where the manga/TV series' timeline begins.\n\nOne of Ryou's most striking traits as a character is his extreme sexual excitability. Especially in the manga, where, as Saeba himself often notes, he experiences an erection every time he sees or even thinks about something sexual. As a result of this, he constantly flirts with, tries to seduce, or even literally harasses most of the female characters he finds sexy. Even with those whom he knows and respects well, to the point of refusing to take orders from men unless their request touches something in his soul. And while he can always pull himself together and take things seriously when needed, various adaptations often downplay this trait of his to still exaggerated, but more tame dimensions."}

It turns out that anyone can use Excalibur. However, no one can put up with its personality (it has a bigger ego than Black Star). The only reason that those who use it are called heroes is that they can put up with its annoying habits, such as a list of one-thousand things he demands to be completed, such as daily five-hour reading sessions. Excalibur was first introduced when Kid and Black Star found a book about him and thus sought him out, only to discover that the book had in fact been written by Excalibur himself. They quickly ditched him due to his personality. His other form is completely the opposite given his elegant weapon form, looking like a cartoon-ish gentlemen with an outrageous mustache and no pants. On the other hand, his legendary powers have been proven by a fellow Shibusen student who found completing the appointed tasks easy. Excalibur can grant great power, light speed, and teleportation, and the wielder can easily defeat three of Shibusen's strongest combined. In the end, Excalibur was put back again because the student could not put up with his annoying sneeze.

He is introduced to ATs by Noyamano family, whom he lives with due to his parents' deaths. He eventually forms Kogarasumaru, and takes on the Trophaeum. Ikki is often characterized as a crow due to a small crow, Kū, using his hair as a nest.\n\n\nIkki is a very upbeat, zany person, who seemingly is as eccentric as just about everyone else in the universe of Air Gear. He delights in eating meat, a privilege he is often deprived of in the Noyamano household by his sisters. He is rash, impulsive, and determined to do everything his way, whether for good or bad. In battle he either comes off as his odinary crazy and unpredictable personality, or his more serious, cold and steely side, which other characters has described as a rare occurrence, and as an intimidating scene. Ikki is totally hooked onto Air Trekking. He treats his ATs with care to such a standard that even his sisters feel jealous of, and his mind is constantly on Air Trekking; for example, during the Kyoto trip he fails to notice Ringo's affection initially, deadset on figuring out a 'Windmill Theory' that another Storm Rider has revealed to him as the secret behind the Rumble King. Ikki is a self-proclaimed genius and very proud of himself, in particular his fighting abilities. In truth he works very hard behind the other's back, as is revealed when Kuu brings his friends to his secret training area, where the scars left over by his training could be seen in chapter 87.\n\nThough his attitude can be described as a lowlife, suitable for his gangster-like persona, and though he likes to go around doing insanely foolish things all the time, Ikki has a tendency to think beyond others' perceivable concept and at several intervals can spout deep philosophy that more often than not will impact others. One such incident was the Pomtemkin brothers' battle, where Ikki's plan caused an initial falling out among the Kogarasumaru, where in fact he had his own solution around that matter. Ikki, though easy to miss the obvious, can be very adept when it comes to spotting small details. In their first Parts War, he alone had noticed that Kazu's ATs were the most worn out among them, a mark of how much he practiced.\n\nHe is noticed to be developing a new skill, as Kururu noticed that his AT was worn out. The day came for the Sleeping Forest and the Genesis to fight, Ringo went to the place where Ikki and his gang stayed and revealed her true feelings for Ikki while dressed as Croissant Mask. He was shocked and realizes that he is an idiot for not noticing Ringo's love. Ikki thinks deeply and even in their battle he can't concentrate and then he realizes that Ringo was always there for him. In recent chapters, it's revealed that the trick Ikki was developing was called \"Null Wind\". It combines the power of all the major riders of Kogarasumaru and creates a storm of wind around Ikki, that stops all wing road riders tricks. With this, Ikki is able to win his battle against Sleipnir.\n\n=Tricks= \nSpinning Wallride Overhang 1800°: \nUPPER SOUL 23Roll: \nMethod Air to Spin That Grab Moonride: \nBackward Cross Ridefall Upper Fang: \"TWINCAM\": \nRoof Gap To Disaster One Foot \"Air line\": \nPile Tornado: Relies on the \"Vacuum Welding\" skill to produce the effects of Tornadogenesis, funneling the air to such consistency that Ikki's kick produces a violently tornado.

Like Asia, as a person who was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school.\n\nAs a Knight, Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds, which, combined with the destructive powers of Durandal, makes her a formidable fighter.

{"mal_id": 1168, "name": "Mayuri Kurotsuchi", "description": "Birthday: March 30\nZodiac sign: Aries\nHeight: 174 cm (5'8½\")\nWeight: 54kg (119 lbs)\nOccupation: 12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute\n\nMayuri Kurotsuchi is Captain of the 12th Division in the Gotei 13 and 2nd president of the Shinigami Research Institute. He gained his position after Kisuke Urahara, the former captain and president, was sentenced into exile by Soul Society. His lieutenant is Nemu Kurotsuchi, his artificially-created \"daughter.\"\n\nMayuri's appearance has a very skeletal look to it with a skull-like visage. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. The one long fingernail is as long as the finger itself. In the anime, Mayuri is revealed to have blue hair and yellow eyes when unmasked. He also wears a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. He repaints his make-up every morning, as he always removes it before going to bed.\n\nMayuri's left arm can extend out like a grappling hook. Mayuri is able to pull out part of his ear, which is Scythe like weapon attached to his body. He is able to blend himself with the environment with some sort of covering that flakes away once he reveals himself.\n\nMayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and personifies the stereotype of the mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as one of the most sadistic and cruel Shinigami. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched—including himself. He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into human bombs in an attempt to capture Uryū Ishida and Orihime Inoue for experimentation. He also withheld vital information about the Bount from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself.\n\nIt is known that Mayuri's favorite food is pike fish, while he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in Seiretei Communication. He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled \"Effective Medication for the Brain,\" which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly it is highly popular among the readers.\n\nIn battle Mayuri likes to play with his opponent torturing little by little until they can hardly stand.\n\n\nMaster Scientist/Inventor: As the head of the Shinigami Research Institute, Mayuri is a talented inventor and scientist, having created a number of devices or techniques to aid him in battle or otherwise. As well Mayuri is a mad scientist embodied, he has no morals or empathy in everyday life and apparently his work is devoid of it as well, he will go to any length he feels is necessary to achieve his goals. He often takes no interest in issues of Soul Society and will rather engage in his research, unless personally requested by the General Yamamoto.\n\nMaster Strategist: Mayuri has a talent for being well prepared. He takes various precautions before engaging in personal combat with an adversary, usually studying them through his various methods in order to gain a clear advantage. He seems to always have a contingency plan if something doesn't work out the way he expects.\n\nBody Modification: It is implied that Mayuri has done extensive research on modifying bodies, and he has upgraded a variety of his own body parts to function as weapons or otherwise provide him with useful abilities. His left arm can extend like a grappling hook, and he is able to pull part of his ear out of his head to form a scythe attached to a rope-like ligament for use as a kusarigama. He can also blend into his environment with the aid of a topical camouflage which flakes away after he reveals himself. More impressively, he has demonstrated the ability to replace functional internal organs with false ones, a feat he performs on himself and his lieutenant to safeguard them from injury. This particular operation is conceived of and carried out in the span of less than an hour.\n\nMaster Chemist: Mayuri has otherwise been shown to be an adept chemist, manufacturing a drug that can slow down a person's perception of time. It is able to make one second seem like 100 years for the unfortunate victim to whom it is administered. An undiluted dose of the drug causes the senses to speed up trillions of times while the relatively \"slow\" body fails to keep up, resulting in paralysis; on the other hand, it is implied that a diluted dose of the drug can greatly enhance the user's reaction speed. Mayuri has also developed a \"regenerative serum,\" which can regrow limbs upon injection.\n\nEnvironment Melding Technique: Another one of Mayuri's abilities likely achieved scientifically is his ability to meld with the color and texture of the environment.\n\nZanpaktou:\nAshisogi Jizō (疋殺地蔵; Leg-Cutting Jizō): Ksitigarbha is a bodhisattva that watches over children and the underworld. In Japan, where he is known as Jizō, he looks rather like a baby dressed as a Buddhist monk; Mayuri's Zanpakutō has what looks like a giant baby's head on it. Its hilt is wrapped in cloth, and has several spiky protrusions sticking out right below the blade, which appear to resemble leaves. Unlike most Shinigami, his Zanpakutō's sheath hangs directly in front of him, instead of to his side as they are commonly worn.\n\nShikai\n\nShikai Special Ability:\n\nBankai\n\nMayuri's Bankai, Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō\nMayuri's Bankai, Konjiki Ashisogi Jizō\n\nBankai Special Ability:\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"}

{"mal_id": 756, "name": "Belldandy", "description": "Belldandy is unflinchingly kind, patient, and warm, not only to Keiichi but to everyone, without exception. However, this does not mean that she is to be taken lightly; Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. The only time at which she has ever revealed her true strength is during the Lord of Terror arc. At the end of this arc, Belldandy completely reconstructed their home from rubble, mentioning that doing so only took one ten-millionth of her power.\n\nBelldandy's capacities and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, \"see\" people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and \"speak\" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she's a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage—although given her personality, \"rampage\" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself.\n\nBelldandy's angel is Holy Bell (Bless餠Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus.\n\nBelldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil. Rather, she works at the Goddess Relief Agency which deals with granting wishes (forming contracts) with humans, similar to Peorth's work at the Earth Assistance Agency."}

The abilities gained from this fruit also make Buggy immune to attacks from knives or swords; any such attack just separates him into his component parts.\n\nIn addition, most of his body is capable of flying through the air, fast enough to propel a man through a wall—with the crucial exception of his feet. However, even though the parts are separate, Buggy can still feel what the part feels (for example, when Luffy attacked Buggy, he separated his torso from his waist, only to find that Luffy was aiming for the crotch. Needless to say this left him with a rather painful result. Also when Buggy launched his hand out to pin down Zoro for Cabaji's Sting of the Unicycle Technique, Luffy stomped on it, inflicting tremendous pain). He also seems to require either a fixed distance from his detachments, or keep them within his line of vision, in order to manipulate them separately.\n\nBesides his Devil fruit abilities, he usually fights with three knives between his fingers.

{"mal_id": 14795, "name": "United Kingdom", "description": "Nation's name: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\nCapital: London\nLanguage: English\nBirthday: April 23\nNational flower: Rose\nHeight: 5'9 (177 cm)\n\nHuman name: Arthur Kirkland\nHeight: 175cm (5'9\")\nAge: 23 (appearance)\n\nMore commonly referred to as \"England\" or \"Britain\", he's a rainy island with the reputation as being the \"delinquent of Europe\". As a kid he was quite violent, and grew up to be a pirate. However, he's hung up his pirate hat and has gone from being a swashbuckling bad boy to a self-proclaimed \"gentleman.\"\n\nSince long ago, he's been on bad terms with France. Both have done terrible things to one another, the most notable in the Hetalia series (on England's part) being when England's army burned Jeanne d'Arc at the stake. A teenage France used to pick on a young England back in the day, but their little squabbles and arguments (even in present times) are usually and have been over extremely petty issues. Despite this, they seem to have an underlying respect for one another and spend every Christmas together as shown in the comics. England also allowed France to 'conquer him when they thought the world was ending, something which France had always dreamed of. They are also shown to be quite close to each other, even if they do bicker often, France being one of the Englishman's closest friends (even if he'll deny it.)\n\nHe raised America as a child after fighting over him with France and Finland. The two were like brothers, but England insisted that America not refer to him as such (the unpleasant memories of his own brothers haunted him). Due to America declaring his independence and fighting against him, their relationship was spoiled. Apparently, on every 4th of July (America's Independence Day) since then, he becomes ill and heartbroken. In present times, the two are always butting heads over something, but deep down, they both care for each other.\n\nAlthough America was like a brother to him, he does have actual blood brothers; Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who have yet to be profiled, were mentioned to hate his guts, going so far as to throw rocks at him, mail curses to him, and shoot arrows at him to keep him away from them. His youngest brother is Sealand, who also seems to hate him, calling him \"Jerk England.\" Even so, England does care for him (though is usually annoyed and frustrated with him and his antics).\n\nHis personality is rather cynical, stubborn, sarcastic, competitive, and cold, even though he claims to be a gentleman. He has a sharp tongue and a potty mouth, but is not a bad person. He's also described as being a tsundere. When he becomes friends with someone, he is surprisingly very loyal to them. France noted him once as having a slender build. England has a strong belief in the supernatural and the occult; he can even perform black magic, see supernatural creatures, and is able to converse with said creatures (such as unicorns, ghosts, fairies, and even on some accounts, a flying bunny and Captain Hook). However, he refuses to believe in aliens. His hobbies include embroidery and other craftsmanship, drinking tea, getting drunk, literature, rock/punk music, and criticizing America's movies. He also loves to cook, but a running gag throughout the entire series is that he sucks at it and that his food has no taste whatsoever (which is why America, who grew up eating his food, is able to eat the strange \"delicacies\" that he does). When drunk, he becomes violent and bitter, often complaining or raving on about America in his drunken state.\n\nHis most noticeable feature are his thick, bushy eyebrows. During his pirate days, he used to set up colonies everywhere (and torment the heck out of Spain). It appears as though all of his colonies (that have been personified so far) possess the same bushy eyebrows (examples being Hong Kong, Wy, and Australia).\n\nAlthough he officially represents the United Kingdom as a whole, among his brothers Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, he is supposed to represent England. Through the Hetalia series, he's also referred to as \"England\" on numerous accounts (even though Hidekaz Himaruya stated that to the other countries of the world, he is simply \"United Kingdom\"), which most of the general fandom is familiar with. The English dubbed version of the anime adaptation refers to him as \"Britain,\" something that, according to the company, was a request from the original Japanese producers."}

{"mal_id": 1045, "name": "Daisuke Jigen", "description": "Age: Late 20s - early 30s \nBirthday: 29 November (The Castle of Cagliostro) \nHeight: 178 cm \nWeight: 70 kg\n\nHe is a smooth gunman who is most seen accompanying Lupin in his endeavors and heists. Despite Jigen disliking Lupin's lust for women, to the end he remains Lupin's loyal and reliable marksman. \n\nHe can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy. He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance. His hat is also an important element to his dead shot accuracy because he uses it for aiming and target acquisition. He is also proficient in the use of many different firearms, such as machine guns, sniper rifles, and even a PTRS anti-tank rifle. Daisuke is also a skilled driver and pilot.\n\nIn the original manga series, Jigen is not always at Lupin's side but lurking in the background until needed. The anime series, however, shows Jigen as extremely loyal to Lupin and willing to partner up anytime for a given heist.\n\nJigen is noted for his quick temper; enemy and friend alike have been victim to his need to repay violence for insult. Both Lupin and Goemon have been on the receiving end of his blows in his response to their frank or comical criticism.\n\nDespite Jigen's gruff facade, he has an ironic sense of humor and genuinely enjoys participating in each caper with his partners. He is, by far, the more pragmatic of the group, with a cynical streak founded in failed romances (his luck with women runs from bad to worse, with love interests often betraying him or dying). He is always distrustful of Fujiko Mine and becomes irritated when Lupin goes along with one of her plans. Among Lupin's group, Jigen is the least apprehensive at taking human life. While he considers killing women and children taboo, he is willing to put down any age or gender who offers a life threat, such as Linda in Part 2 Episode 26.\n\nWhere Lupin and Goemon Ishikawa XIII both have unique sartorial tastes, Jigen is pure basics. His typical wardrobe is a dark grey, dark green or black business suit, along with a white or light blue colored dress shirt, a black tie, and his ever-present dark grey or black broad-brimmed fedora; the hat ranks as his most prized possession outside of his weaponry. During the third anime series, Jigen's outfit is more light colored and his hatband has a cross-hatched or grid pattern design (similar to the original manga interpretation of the character); however the black look is most applied for OVA productions and TV specials. Jigen's thick hair is typically collar-length and unevenly cut. His chin curtain beard varies from an inch to three inches long and is also unruly. A few episodes of the anime use an occasional gimmick where the character has his hat pulled forward so that only the lower half of his face is visible or, if he's without his hat, his hair will be covering his upper face and eyes. However such episodes are rare; and Jigen's face is plainly shown with or without his hat in most animated depictions.\n\nJigen is the \"big brother\" of the group, and often serves as the voice of reason to Lupin's impulsiveness, as he must because of his friendship with Lupin as well as out of sheer professionalism. However, he has long since resigned himself to having to go along with the craziest of schemes. Jigen, like the rest of the Lupin gang, is adept with disguises and can pilot virtually any motorized vehicle, including planes and tanks. He has even controlled a NASA Space Shuttle. He is also a tough hand-to-hand opponent, capable of knocking out an attacker with one blow.\n\nWhile his racial origins may be in question, Jigen was at one time a famed bodyguard and assassin for many American criminal mobs. Of several stories regarding his past, the most popular has him an American mobster who moved to Japan on the lam; there he adopted a Japanese identity and name (\"Jigen\" is the conventional Japanese word for \"dimension\", not a name). According to Lupin, Jigen's hobbies are limited due to his stay-at-home preference. When he does go out, he usually attends target practice, visits a favorite bar, plays poker, enjoys a boxing match or eats at a chop house-style restaurant. He also has a weakness for Spaghetti Westerns, lounging, classical music (except in Episodes 79 and 89 of Part 2), and hearty American food.\n\nJigen's most obvious pastime is smoking; there is hardly a time when he not seen with a cigarette, usually one bent in a number of directions. His preferred brands have been Pall Mall Filter Longs or Marlboro Red. He is also seen occasionally smoking a briar pipe. As well, Jigen enjoys drinking scotch, bourbon, vodka, beer and occasionally fine wines; he has a \"heavyweight's\" resistance to intoxication.\n\nThe Tokyo Pop releases of the original Lupin manga note in their preface that Jigen's appearance and temperament are based on the actor James Coburn, especially Coburn's role, Britt, in The Magnificent Seven. This has been confirmed by Monkey Punch during a 2003 Dallas, Texas anime convention interview. In a television documentary celebrating the manga's history, Monkey Punch stated he based the Jigen/Lupin relationship on Alain Delon and Charles Bronson's teaming in the 1968 film Adieu l'ami.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Lupin III)"}

{"mal_id": 633, "name": "Canti", "description": "Canti is a medical robot with what looks like a television set for a head. He was manufactured by Medical Mechanica, but taken over by Atomsk as a way to escape MM. After having his head broken by Haruko he is recruited by her as an assistant, however he proves to be no good for much other than washing dishes and fetching drinks for the family. It is later revealed that Atomsk can manifest through him, with Naota being the catalyst. Atomsk's symbol appears on Canti's screen when he absorbs Naota; the symbol is a corruption of the kanji characters for \"adult\" (大人). This symbol also appears on him when Naota \"swings the bat\" in Full Swing. When Canti is absorbed by the terminal core in FLCLimax, a similar symbol appears, but he uses the kanji for \"child\" (小人).\n\nThe emotions of Canti are very human-like, despite his looks. He is embarrassed about his broken head (where Haruko hit him) and is looking for the pieces to glue back together in episode two. He wears the box on the back of his head for the same reason- shame. He is also extremely polite, extending a helping hand to Lieutenant Kitsurubami even after she attempted to destroy him.\n\nCanti also dons a halo and fake wings (which Haruko was wearing in early episode two). Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him Lord Canti after \"The God of Black Flames\" in a video game she plays. The rest of the cast call him by this title throughout the rest of the series. Apparently, he can also eat curry with his \"mouth,\" but it is never really explained how.\n\nNo voice actors have been added to this character.

Near the beginning of the series she was engaged to Athrun Zala through an arranged marriage. Though (according to the drama CD) the two were in love when they first met, their feelings diminished as time went on and the engagement became more political then ever before.\n\nThe pink-haired princess enters the series when she is traveling in a civilian vessel for a memorial ceremony on Junius Seven. The ship is mistaken for a ZAFT military aircraft, and is attacked by the Earth Alliance. Lacus is escorted to a lifepod, and escapes safely. Shortly thereafter, Lacus' escape pod is discovered by Kira in the Strike. He brings the pod back to the Archangel.\n\nThe doors to the life pod open and out hops a small, pink, robotic ball. Following after it is Lacus Clyne herself in a bit of dismay that she was saved by Earth forces. Despite being enemies, the girl is cheery and kind to everyone on the ship as they keep her hostage. ZAFT forces discover the Archangel, and a battle breaks out. Before the Earth Alliance can suffer more loss, Natarle Badgiruel opens a channel to the enemy. It is then revealed to ZAFT that Lacus Clyne, the famous idol, is onboard the Archangel.\n\nKira is distraught and, due to Flay's abusive words, comes direly close to an emotional breakdown; however, Lacus attempts to comfort him. The couple find that they both know Athrun Zala on a personal level, and even that Athrun made Lacus' Haro/Pink-chan (her pink, robotic ball) and Kira's Torii (his flying bird robot). Kira decides to return Lacus to where she belongs with Athrun.\n\nEven before meeting Kira, Lacus had an indirect influence on the war. She spread her opinion throughout PLANT by singing a song of peace, her lyrics filled with the hope of harmony between the nations. After encountering the Archangel, she expresses a larger need to achieve peace by aiding Kira many more times, causing Athrun to question his purpose for taking part in the war, and much more."}
